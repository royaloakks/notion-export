a series of promotional posters have popped up in numerous locations. The adverts contain the Blink-182 logo as well as the phrase ‘One more time…’, which could be the title of the new album or a single.

According to the [Blink-182 Italia fan account](https://twitter.com/blink182italia?s=20) on X (formerly known as Twitter), the posters also feature what appear to be song lyrics: “*Do I have to die to hear you miss me?/ Do I have to die to hear you say goodbye?/ I don’t want to act like there’s tomorrow/ I don’t want to wait to do this one more time*.”

Additionally, a QR code on the ads directs fans to a new ‘stall’ page on the band’s official website. When clicking through, users are told that the site is currently “closed for maintenance” as it shows someone cleaning Blink-related graffiti off a tiled wall.

Various classic songs soundtrack the video before a brief snippet of new material eventually plays out. [Visit the page here](https://www.blink182.com/stall/), and see the preview image below.
