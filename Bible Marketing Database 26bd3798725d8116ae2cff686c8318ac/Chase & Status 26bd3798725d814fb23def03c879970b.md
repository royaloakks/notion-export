Fans don't just enter an email address to try to win tickets though: they have to [complete three missions on the 'LDN Calling' site](https://musically.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=d52f6bce2f35240a62f393249&id=5d59b47b25&e=f55edb22f5), which are being dropped one a day. The first involves perusing footage of some of the new game's environments to spot numbers, which when put together will reveal the date of the concert. The game itself comes out on 10 November, which neatly is the same day the new mixtape from Chase & Status, '2 Ruff, Vol. 1', comes out.
