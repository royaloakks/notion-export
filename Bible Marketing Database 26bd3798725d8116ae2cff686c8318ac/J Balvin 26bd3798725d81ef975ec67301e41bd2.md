He's now a playable character within the endless-runner game, and his latest single, the DJ Khaled and Usher-featuring 'Dientes', will also feature. There's also an environmental angle to the partnership between Balvin and developer Sybo. A third partner, PlanetPlay, is described as a "climate-conscious game marketplace". A portion of sales from in-app purchases of Balvin's character will be donated via PlanetPlay to the Hongera Clean Cookstove Project in Kenya. PlanetPlay will also be selling limited-edition t-shirts based on Balvin, offsetting carbon emissions as they go.
