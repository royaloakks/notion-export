One-off 12”s planted secretly in record stores globally including Other Music in New York (RIP) and Rough Trade East in London. Each one featured 20 seconds of unique audio of a voice reading out a series numbers along with each individual sleeve featuring what appeared to be a fill-in-the-gaps clue “—— / —— / —— / XXXXXX / —— / ——”. 

Shows on BBC Radio 1 and NPR played snippets of audio (with no context) revealing more unique numbers to fill in the gaps in the same audio style as that found on the previously located 12”s. 

The BoC fan blog,  2020k, discovered a YouTube channel called Hell Interface (a past alias of Boards of Canada) using a blank video, but featured an image if you hovered your cursor over the timeline, to link to another video, which featured a new number being read in the same style as the 12”.

BoC updated their official YouTube playlist moving three Twoism-inspired videos to the top. A user on the BoC unofficial messagboard Twoism spotted that one of the rotating banners on had been altered to feature a strange pattern of text. A user downloaded the .gif banner and opened it in Notepad to reveal a string of code, which led to two private Soundcloud links on what looked to be an official BoC’s account. Both featured music buried under distortion and when combined, the tracks resembled the snippets already discovered across the world, and included a new number 628315. Copying and pasting part of the code into a hex editor revealed an image, which confirmed the placement of the number. 

Finally an advert on Adult Swim revealed what appeared to be the last part of the six-piece code. 

All of the pieces of the puzzle so far were pieces to reveal the string of numbers to be “699742 / 628315 / 717228 / 936557 / —— / 519225”.

There was one piece of the code still remaining to be located, eventually it formulated a password: 699742628315717228936557813386519225, which took you to a promo video for the album.

Search FACT Mag and the 2020K blog for a more detailed map of the information and how it rolled out.
