When you preorder(ed) an album via iTunes you got immediate downloads of already released singles from that album. Spoon did the same thing but with vinyl and 150 participating record stores. You went into one of the stores, preordered a vinyl copy of their yet to be released album, They Want My Soul and you received a 10‚Äù vinyl featuring 3 songs from the album. Head back to the store on album release day with you receipt and pick up the album
