# What are you doing that’s worth talking about?  Draft

A fanbase, the market, cultures; whatever you choose to call it are more transient now than ever before. More platforms to communicate across. Endless list of genres intertwining. Trends to capitalise on (or preferably ignore). Niches becoming ever more granular. The democratisation of access to music coupled with the ever decreasing power of previous gatekeepers means our approach to artist development and marketing needs to adopt a far more experimental attitude to how we communicate with our fans. Like it or not the increasing reliance on algorithms to facilitate the discovery of new music should tell you that engagement between artist and fan is paramount. The more consistent, interesting and imaginative the marketing you adopt, the more rich the fan’s response will be. Not only will this work on an emotional level with fans but the algorithm will likely respond accordingly also. 

We learn so much from what we get back in response to what we put out into this world. We need to place greater emphasis on absorbing the information that we receive and be adaptive. That isn’t to say artists should be compromising their vision or pivoting at every turn. Instead it’s a body language of creativity that understands that working across a number of cultural touch-points surrounding an artist will yield a much greater value of fan engagement. The more opportunities we create for fans to engage with an artist, the more we get back in return, the better we become at understanding what fans want and how best to serve them.

This results in a better quality of fan, those that will speak louder and bring in more fans. Fans with urgency each time we release new music; those who sell out the ticket presale; buy the limited merch drop; those that like comment and share each piece of content. 

Simply enough, if the best you can tell fans that the single is “out now” or that you’re “excited” for them to hear your new release, don’t be surprised if you’re not seeing the highest quality of response in return. 

In Discord, on Reddit, in the Instagram, TikTok and YouTube comments – what will fans talk about when they’re there? It’s not difficult to conclude that the greater diversity of artist and creative output, the more fans will have to talk about and engage, not just with the artist but with each other.

Adopting a more open ended strategy isn’t to suggest that knowledge, experience and expertise don’t count for anything. Being able to draw upon these skill sets to identify the areas and entry points for fans to engage with artists will move us quicker and more effectively to growth. It’s now essential that an additional skill of understanding the unpredictability and working with that effectively is just as important

We will learn so much from what we get back in response to what we put out into this world. We need to place greater emphasis on absorbing the information that comes back and be adaptive. That isn’t to say we’re compromising an artist’s vision or pivoting at every turn. Instead it’s a body language of creativity that understands that working across a number of cultural touch points surrounding an artist will yield a much greater value of fan engagement. in turn you get a better quality of fan, ones that will speak louder and bring in more fans, ones that turn up with every release, show, merch drop and piece of content. We’re an industry fixated on numbers nut need to spend more time on increasing the value of fans to breed loyalty. 

The more opportunities we create for a fan to engage with an artist, the more we will get back in return, the better we become at understanding what fans want and how best to engage with them. 

Simply enough, if the best you can say to fans is that you’re “excited” for them to hear your new single, don’t be surprised if the you’re not seeing an engaged response to learn from.

When you begin engaging you can identify where the fans really congregating, where these discussions are taking place and what they’re saying in response. What are they giving back?

Tyler reference about people not talking about their music but doing a hot wings interview – Nardwar interview

If you create a Discord what will they talk about when they’re there? The clue is in the name, of course. The artist is the subject, obviously fans will discuss other topics in the spirit of general-chat but it’s not difficult to conclude that the greater diversity of artist and their output, the more fans will have to talk about and engage with each other on.

We’re an industry fixated on numbers but need to spend more time on increasing the value of fans to breed loyalty. 

In his [recent interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGY71JdCny4) with Nardwar, Tyler, The Creator highlighted the very simple, and what probably feels like an evermore increasingly novel idea of “talking about the music”.

> we're at a point where a musician who you know for music is being interviewed on a platform about music talking in detail about music his passion and what he's known for and people are like why does he keep doing that but you know if I was on here gossiping or talking about so and so who got beefed oh man it's people will feed into it and it's like no we need to get back to talking about music we need to stop [ __ ] going sneaker shopping or [ __ ] deep throating hot wings for an hour like talk about your album talk about music talk about the 15 songs that you guys have spent time to get mixed and mastered and put your heart into and produced and did all these things and then when the album comes out and it sells two copies everyone's confused but it's like they don't want to talk about the music or the album they rather [ __ ] go eat chicken wings and sneaker shoing like so I hope that overall every musician gets to a point where they sit and speak about their music and the music that they love and the conversation about music just comes back because the fact that you could get every song for $10 what that subconsciously I think does is have people like not respect music is worthy and when people don't talk about it that makes it I just think that it's just not a lot of love in it even from a fan
