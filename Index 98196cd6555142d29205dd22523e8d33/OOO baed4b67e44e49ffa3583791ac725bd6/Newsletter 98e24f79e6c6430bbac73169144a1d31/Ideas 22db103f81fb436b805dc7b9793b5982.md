**Ways To Be Remarkable:**

Activations - highly visible and inspiring fomo

Generosity - going above and beyond for fans in unexpired ways

Social commentary - being part of the conversation, social issue and inspiring change

Innovative - pushing boundaries, new ways of engagement or approaches to creativity

Mystery - it creates intrigue. What do they know that I don't? Story telling

What else?

**Mystery and Anonymity:**

Examples and what we learned

What enticed us?

Is it an artist we already know?

How did they do that?

What does it tap into on a psychological level?

Jai Paul, The Weeknd, Two Shell

The relentless focus towards monetising superfans is going to create a zero sum game. When one artist has successfully rinsed as much money as possible from a fan, there won’t be anything less to go to other artists.

Tools - we’ve largely solved the problem of connection. The myriad of social media platforms and related tools for optimising connection on those platforms. This will be an area than will continue to innovate and so it should - as new rules of engagement one into play and the birth of new networks and their rules of engagement. However, let’s not confuse these tools with marketing. How you connect with people on these platforms and using the tools are underpinned by the principles of your offering.

Idents - Benji, Newscast, call Me if you get lost. Can you do a test - play the audio and guess the ident before revealing the answer? Start with Pavlov’s dog as the trigger. Kendrick release of a song before the album campaign starts - the heart part 5. Reference Daniel Ariely P179. The Alka Seltzer add, two plops and a fizz. 

Pusha T, Mike Will Made It

Sam Virji – it’s sammy isn’t it?

Book recommendations 

Hand signs in culture – Kurupt FM

Discipline defined as the work you do now for the pay off later. Practice your colors, practice your interviews. Be a student 

Industry awards: who are they for? An industry laying people off are celebrating everyone else? This isn’t a cynical play on not looking for the positive but if we are only here for the artists have we not got more work to do?

Sports development versus music. Mavin Records have an incubator scheme 

We’re trying to move the artist from the brain’s system 2 needing to work and occupy space into the system 1 area, where the artist hasn’t so much been decoded to make sense intuitively but that it’s found it’s place with a reactionary urgency… it’s available. 

We spend a lot of time talking about fan bases, consolidating people into a place they can communicate amongst themselves in the spirit of the artist. But what are they going to speak about when they’re there? How excited you were to release the song in the hope their excitement will sustain a conversation long enough in the community? The more you put into your art the more your fans will have to talk about when they’re there. 

Barriers to community. Think about a far flung community such as one in Alaska, think about the difficulty in getting there, the lifestyle changes, think about how much you’d value the community to support you. Now think about the artist community, the slightly higher barrier to entry and how that strengthens the community - what’s the cost of entry? Find example of the focus group who had to do something embarrassing - what book? 

Formula 1 Drive To Survive stats (Nathan Baugh?) and the power of story. Post Office scandal being told as a story. Notting Hill house, Kendrick Chinese shop - when it’s dramatised it creates connection. 

“Post Office” search term on Google Trends

Discord

Have an international fanbase, one where whenever someone logs on their is conversation taking place. 

Fans

When asked about creativity David Ogilvy said “it’s nothing but a high-fallutin word for the work I need to do between now and next Tuesday”. 

The same could be said of the industry’s new favourite word “super fans”… because great marketing has and will continue to be about the fans. Those are who were effectively trying to communicate with. Those are who drive music discovery with more value than any algorithm. The latter might be faster and with an accuracy but fans advocating for an artist will forge deeper connections. It’s not revolutionary, it’s just that some have come to realise it later than others. 

Rory Sutherlands take on train engineers - they maximise for efficiency and ROI, but they’re aren’t thinking with alchemy. Because marketing and planning isn’t the shortest distance between two points - yet that’s what we’re typically trying to create for fans - a direct line from fan to artist. 

The pervasive myth that we don’t know how to break artists anymore instead due to us systematically dismantling the music industry in favour of every shiny new toy, it’s left people looking around as to what to do next. It’s hard work to play the long game and some might not work in the same way as the short game reveals. But the short game might not be revealing enough. The easier it comes the easier it can leave (on TT stardom). *Pyschological study on entry to a group - the higher the barrier the greater the value emphasis placed on belonging.*

Research. 

When you begin working with an artist. Do the research:

Ask questions

Read the interviews

What were the influencers?

Listen to the artists

Read the books 

Listen to the podcasts

Create the moodboard but not just visual
