# Hands

When we talk about marketing we’re talking about people, and when people come together and interact they form cultures. It’s often easy to approach marketing thinking big; blue sky thinking; fortune favouring the bold and that the biggest gesture is the one that will be noticed and make the biggest impact. However, influencing culture rarely if ever comes from one or two big gestures, because typically the spectacle is very much that, it’s big and bold but not sustainable. It’s a hit of adrenalin, it helps penetrate the people; for those who are already a fan

Culture is one big secret handshake

It’s an ‘if you know you know’ statement of belonging
