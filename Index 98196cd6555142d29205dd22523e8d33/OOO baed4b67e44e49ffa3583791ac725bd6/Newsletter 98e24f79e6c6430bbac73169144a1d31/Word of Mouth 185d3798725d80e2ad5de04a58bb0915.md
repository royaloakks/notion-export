# Word of Mouth

There is league table of the most overused and misunderstood words in the music industry. 

As un-revolutionary as it sounds, i firmly believe that word of mouth is still our strongest route in spreading an idea. Gaining new fans. Creating connection.

Yes, you could argue an influencer or podcaster or even a journalist (thankfully they still exist) is speaking about something and if you’re paying attention, you’re effectively listening. 

if you have a group of 10 friends, and 6 of them are listening to an artist. Or have bought tickets to a gig or festival. Your greatest strength in influencing those other 4 friends isn’t Instagram ads, it’s those 6 friends who have already bought in.
