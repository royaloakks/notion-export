# We’re Breaking Ourselves Trying To Break Artists

A few collected thoughts on the music industry’s pervasive belief that we no longer know how to break artists.

**What did it meant to break an artist prior to our reliance on TikTok as a dominant means of achieving rapid scale?** Was it chart placement? Selling out Brixton Academy? Radio A-Listed records? Magazine covers across music, fashion and broadsheets? Consistent global New Music Friday and New Music Daily playlist placement? 100K followers on Instagram? 50K mailing list subscribers? A Netflix sync? All of the above or a variation of achieving these milestones? Could you have chart success and sell out a 5,000 capacity venue without PR and Radio support? Or the inverse; what if you have 3 straight BBC Radio 1 A-List records, 5 star album reviews and 100K instagram followers but land outside the top 20? Have you ‘broken’? 

**Has virality on TikTok created the perception of an almost instant break?** Even this is tenuous seeing as momentum has to build even on TikTok. But the relative speed of this feeling of breaking compared to the hard and composed work of a long game of developing an artist through via radio, press, live and establishing a meaningful socials presence and following has skewed the myopic focus on TikTok even more so.

**Are we saying we can’t ‘break’ artists anymore or that we can’t go viral?** And it’s not that we can’t, it’s that we don’t know how to create those circumstances so specifically to give us the feeling of control. TikTok is inconsistent because it has a billion users around the world. But that inconsistency means we’re demotivated by our efforts to use the platform and the knock on effect is that we’ll move off artists quicker because we’re concluding that **we** don’t know where to go next. 

It’s time to redefine what we mean by ‘breaking’.

The pervasive narrative of the music industry in recent times has been that we no longer know how to break artists. There are countless factors contributing to this belief, these include:

- increased number of artists and songs as a result of low barrier to music creation and distribution.

The pervasive narrative of the music industry in recent times has been that we no longer know how to break artists. The myriad factors contributing to this belief range from the ease and accessibility of music creation tools (now supercharged by AI) through to the 100,000+ songs being uploaded to the likes of Spotify every day. We’ve long been moving beyond singular cultures and vertical growth within a handful of dominant genres towards wider niches and as such, the opportunities to grow within these niches mean the critical mass we observed in years gone by looks a lot smaller than it did.

What we can do to satisfy our objective of breaking an artist is to simply redefine what we mean by ‘breaking’. Sounds like cheating but such is the negative impact upon our motivation for artist development because of this seemingly now unachievable objective means we need to alter the lens in which we view this magical trophy.

It’s almost low hanging fruit these days to take aim at TikTok and the negative impacts it has and continues to have on artist development, and not least of all the pressure placed upon artist’s and their teams to focus so heavily on the platform as a means for “development”. BUT – lets do it anyway.

I propose two points that are contributing to the continuing belief that we no longer know how to break artists, and they are both closely interconnected. One is our observation and experiences of music going viral on TikTok. The second is the systematic dismantling of the foundations of supporting media; newspapers and magazines, blogs and radio. We’ll even include Instagram.

If you’re lucky enough to have remembered a time prior to TikTok and the music industry’s reliance upon it, ask yourself this; how did we know when an artist had ‘broken’? Was it chart placement? Selling out Brixton Academy? Radio A-Listed records? Magazine covers across music, fashion and broadsheet? Consistent global New Music Friday and New Music Daily playlist placement? 100K followers on Instagram? 50K mailing list subscribers? A Netflix sync? All of the above or a variation of having achieved at least 3 of these milestones? Can you have chart success and sell out 5K capacity venues without the spoils of status that a well executed PR and Radio campaign can bring? Or the inverse, what if you have 3 straight BBC Radio 1 A-List records, 5 star album reviews and 100K instagram followers but land outside the top 20? Have you ‘broken’? 

Success will be perceived differently by every artist, every manager, label, media gatekeeper and voice within the music industry whether they have a dog in the fight or not. I think we can all probably agree that a few of the above achievements would conclude that an artist has broken – albeit a top 10 album and a sold out Alexandra Palace from the outside looking in might look like success but feel very differently if the P&L is in the bright red to have gotten the artist there.

I propose that the virality we’ve experienced through TikTok has created a perception of an almost instant break. An overnight success. Even this is tenuous seeing as momentum has to build even on TikTok but the relative speed of this feeling of breaking compared to the hard and composed work of a long game prior to that, via radio, PR, live, establishing a meaningful socials presence and following. 

The definition of breaking felt very different and we’d do well to redefine how we perceive an artist to have broken. What we’re really saying isn’t so much that we apparently can’t break artists anymore, what we’re really saying is we can’t go viral. And it’s not that we can’t, it’s that we don’t know how to create those circumstances so specifically to give us the feeling of control. TikTok is inconsistent because it has a billion users around the world. But that inconsistency means we’re demotivated by our efforts to use the platform and the knock on effect is that we’ll move off artists quicker because we’re concluding that **we** don’t know where to go next. 

TikTok is a problem without a solution. It’s not to say we shouldn’t try but are we any closer to unlocking the platform with enough consistent strategies as to reap the benefits? How many likes, views, creations are enough? How many of these metrics is enough to trigger a break? To trigger an uplift off platform? An uplift in streams, tickets? Are we breaking artists or simple breaking songs? 

We should accept that there’s no definitive answer because like any market (a collection of people) it will forever shift and evolve. But this supercharged market connecting a billion people is so unpredictable it’s like trying to catch a unicorn. Just when you’re close, it’ll fly off in the other direction. Again, this isn’t to say we shouldn’t engage and continue with the work of trying to understand the rules of engagement - but we need a far greater balance to artist development beyond the myopic focus that has been placed on just one platform. 

Its almost criminal the disproportionate share of voice TikTok has dominated in meeting rooms and marketing strategies when it comes to artist development. 

And let’s say it for what it is, when we’re talking about a ‘break’ what we really mean is a ‘hit’. We’re talking about breaking songs in the hope that it breaks an artist. And it’s true, TikTok is where hits are made. Almost every song that has become a hit in the last couple of years has had TikTok to thank for it. But there’s an inverse, not every song on TikTok that experiences virality by way of millions of views and thousands of creations has become a chart hit. The hard work begins in moving form breaking songs to breaking artists. Even when you do have that hit, does it mean tickets and sustains streams? Is that actually us breaking artists? No. Can that contribute to us breaking at an accelerated rate? Yes. That’s not a bad thing, it gets us to where we want to be quicker but far too much focus and energy is being gambled on this one hopeful moment That it’s almost laziness at this point. 

We shouldn’t not try and use the platform. We can’t deny this is an area where a lot, particularly younger audiences discover new music. How many of those turn into fans? It offers scale at an unprecedented rate

At the turn of the century we swam against the unstoppable tsunami of the internet and the rise of P2P networks as a means towards new consumption models for music. The stranglehold the music industry had on music formats and pricing was about to shift and the industry could see it. We (mostly) learned some important lessons during that period and I’d propose that it made the industry consider how it responded to emerging models of new music discovery. As such i’d say there was a more embracing notion as we attempted to rebuild what we once had; both the monetary and cultural value of music. But i’d also suggest we became greedy and fickle; when the sun began shining on a new avenue for music discovery, we quickly moved over. This makes sense, we’d be stupid to ignore where audiences congregate and fanbases can be formed but we’ve been doing so at the expense of the foundations that have come before it. 

Are we saying we don’t know how to break artists or we don’t know how to create momentum? Or momentum with any consistency. One thing that we’ve learned is that social media isn’t reliable enough to be consistent as tech companies change algorithms. It’s the 0-60… or if we’re wanting to make for the allowances of uncertainty, 0-80. When you’ve got to that point it’s easier to steer the ship, you have motion and you’re more responsive as you’ve had a greater understanding of what works and what doesn’t, where the potholes are. 

Not to say that the remaining 20% is easy, far from it you’re more educated with what you have. And when you’re at the top of that mountain, there’s always a view of the next. 

Artists develop in plain sight, a song or ep goes up and not always have they thought beyond that. Develop as much as you can - discuss, set up a community of support around you where ideas can constantly flow. WhatsApp groups with a committed few. Those who are going to ask tough questions, more than any one on the street can 

The industry isn’t wholly to blame - we have to shift with the market but we are reaping the consequences and the diminishing returns by a shrinking industry of support. Same goes for grass roots venues but that discussion is for another time 

Maybe it’s because to break needs the breadth of media to tell a story and we’ve been shrinking that? 

We’re unfulfilled in the work because the world is tethered to your viral; which is too unpredictable. it doesn’t lend itself to creativity it lends itself to optimisation… 30 seconds, grab them in the first 3 secomds.  You can be creative but it rarely rewards long term planning 

What are we leaving ourselves to break artists with? Reference Judi’s tweets about blogs and sites that are now gone. 

The music industry is indirectly responsible but could there have been a world where all of this coexists? 

Our constant desire for growth has been at the expense of a foundation. We’ve become so focused with reestablishing revenue at the levels of 1999 we’ve now become intoxicated with the idea of more more more that nothing else has mattered. 

Are we trying to find an engineering solution to a creative problem? When we’re busy we want automation. We want to employ methods that repeat results we have endeavoured to maximise our ROI of our valuable resource: time. Except people never stand stil. They change. Our marketing efforts need to change accordingly. Continuously evolve as people respond to the world around them. The longer we spend developing an artist the better we come and knowing how fans will respond to the artist. This is as close as we’ll get to consistency closely related to an engineering mindset. Our access to data has us believing that it’s all science. That causation is in our grasp. But it’s killing our creativity. We’re outsourcing it to influencers who aren’t in the business of developing **our** artists. When we dismantled the music media we dismantled an infrastructure that cared about music and an agenda of moving the conversation forward. In discovering new music and elevating it as to ensure their own growth and sustainability. Influencers care about their following.
