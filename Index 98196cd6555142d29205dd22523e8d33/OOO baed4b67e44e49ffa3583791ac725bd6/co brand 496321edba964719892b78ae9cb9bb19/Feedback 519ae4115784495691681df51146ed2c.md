**General Questions / Feedback**

- [ ]  Graph showing performance metrics for the creator’s video(s)
- [ ]  How do you delete Creators from a Creator List?
- [ ]  Leaderboard of creators and their content of a specific song – shows previous peak like ChartMetric. How do we know when something is performing and needs boosting – when it surpasses the creator’s Media Views and Median Engagement Rate in Analyze Content?
- [x]  How do you track vids from an event? Like with Disclosure at their shows, was this based on us tracking an official sound or were we tracking mentions / @’s?
- [x]  Segment page and Songs Performance to provide similar stats as a Songs Page page
    - last 24 hour performance
- [x]  ‘Add To List’ from Creator Details window
- [x]  Creator Details view – if multiples show videos in order of most recent to first
- [x]  How long does data take to populate on platform after a song is being tracked? Does it backdate the data or start from when the song is added / tracking begins?
- [ ]  When video performances slow in views or engagement begins to decline, do we ever observe that reversing? Engagement going back up on a video?
- [ ]  How can we correlate posts to streams? Can you illustrate on the graph when videos were posted? Or when videos began to display key view / engagement growth?

**Segments Page**

Can we analyse the impactful creators & posts in the way we can on the Song’s page?

Be able to see who has posted in the last 24 / 48 hours for example and add to a creator list

---

**Songs Page**

Creator & Content Analysis page – ability to add creators to a new or previously established creator list

---

**Graph**

General – observe a song’s performance from early on to see if there’s correlating spikes between TT and Spotify streams for example? The below shows steady Spotify streams which is likely sustained from being embedded in as a song.

Artist: Rushy

Song: Pressure

**Analyse Content**

When we want to reach out to creators who have posted a video using a song we have to select a promotion, which we have pre-made. What if we just want to obtain the boost code and not propose a promotion / brief? 

---

**Creates Trigger**

How granular can we get? If we observe a graph of creates across 7 days that appears steady, but then observe a 48 hour period where creates spike, can we observe the posts just in those two days to try and determine if a creator triggered the spike? Would we make some assumptions such as a creator’s video with high views / likes followed by a spike in creates concludes that this specific creator is the trigger?
