    - we suggest leaning into these, engaging with them either by liking, reposts, even commenting which add further excitement in validating the fans
- We could consider how we orchestrate a bit more of a leak
    - This could be instrumental-only
    - YouTube ““ecco2k x mechatok x fakemink type beat - _sink.wav”
    - Cold DMs to some top fans from both FM and Mechatok

**Pre- / On-Release**

- Pop-up show in London
- Announced day of with a few hours notice
- 100-150 cap room
- Artists post to stories with a signup so we can then send show details later (RSVP helps us collect data for future)
- Track drops at the show
- We capture content from the show
- Maximum hype about the track with lots of videos posting

**On-Release / Post-Release**

- Track releases 24-48 hours after the show
- Capitalise on all the hype of the track from the show
- We have multiple content to repurpose to boost and seed further to fans / creators
- We release early in the week to maximise lean forward listening on streaming, sends message to algorithm how powerful their fanbases are to then maximise further discovery and editorial on DSPs

As Mikey mentioned, attached is a bit of analysis we ran based on LV Sandals to help illustrate some of where the audience is engaging.

### Pre-Release / On-Release

- Response to the fakemink x Ecco2k post on Instagram was really positive and there feels more mileage in teasing a collaboration
- We want fans to fill in the blanks and claim agency over the discovery of the fact there *might* be a song that exists between these 3 artists
    - Ecco2k to post image of him and fakemink in the studio without any context (to follow that fakemink has already posted)
    - post video of each other in the studio, could be listening to the song in the background – Mechatok’s socials (as above, continuing the chain and letting fans piece the puzzle together)

- As we progress the teasing campaign each artist could post an IG Story with a link to signup, again without context
    - This could be simultaneous or one day apart, each artist with one word
        - Ecco2k: Kitchen
        - fakemink: Sink
        - Mechatok: Drama
        - We can utilise Cobrand to collect email and / or phone number, and fan’s social media accounts
    
- We then use this list to send out clips of the track
    - This could link through to a private Soundcloud upload or anonymous Reddit with more teasing information
    - We could repeat this process with a clip from the video linking through to a newly created YouTube account or Finsta
    - We can also set custom voicemails if fans were to call they could hear a message from the artist or snippet of the song

- If fans connect their social accounts in the signup we can identify the most engaged and strategise messaging to those we know will post about the track teasing
- Ultimately in addition to each respective artist’s socials accounts we have collected data for better direct connection and marketing to communicate the song on release

### Post-Release

- Seed content to targeted creators and channels, which fit within the three artist’s worlds
    - **Edit/ Lyric pages**: these can have a sizeable impact on streaming, whilst keeping aesthetic in tact and spend low.

    - **Luxury Narrative Amplification:** analysis showed strong trend in two cases across LV Sandals across this theme, largely due to each artist’s affinity to higher-end clothing/brands. We would aim to amplify this trend across a wide range of pages, from edits to influencers.

    - **Fan Pages (IG, TT):** start and build a cross section of fanpages. Use clips and photos to seed across a number of accounts to help drive awareness of the track but also help build the broader fan base. [Reference](https://www.tiktok.com/@eurorain?lang=en) for what a page can look like.
