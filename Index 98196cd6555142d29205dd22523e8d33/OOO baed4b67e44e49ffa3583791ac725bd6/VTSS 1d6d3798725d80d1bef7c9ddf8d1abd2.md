This dynamic shows up in engagement too: when she speaks up (be it about misogyny in music or advocating diversity), fans often respond with supportive comments like “thank you for speaking truth” – while a few detractors might grumble, her core fanbase rallies behind her values.
- In summary, **fans engage with VTSS in multifaceted ways**: they feed off her intense musical output, they connect with her personable online voice, and they participate in conversations (sometimes heated) about her art’s place in the wider scene.

    - **Memorable Live Moments:** She has a habit of **dropping unreleased edits or local shout-outs** during sets, creating a special moment for those in attendance.

- VTSS’s fanbase overlaps with those of several DJs/producers in the **hard techno**, **EBM** (Electronic Body Music), and **rave revival** scenes.
- **VTSS herself has acknowledged her musical peers**, giving insight into who her fans might also follow. In the aforementioned Reddit interaction, she personally recommended artists like **Héctor Oaks, Kobosil, Dax J, Randomer, AnD, Sunil Sharpe,** and **Bjarki** to a fan seeking similar sounds (This list reads like a who’s-who of the **contemporary techno underground** – all artists known for high-BPM, industrial or rave-inflected styles)
- Music publications have also drawn parallels. *DJ Mag* explicitly said VTSS is for fans of “**SPFDJ, Courtesy, [and] I Hate Models**”
- Another significant overlapping artist is **LSDXOXO**. Operates in a similar space of high-energy club music with a queer, playful twist. He and VTSS share fans and have worked together on RED, VTSS also remixed LSDXOXO’s “Sick Bitch” and they’ve performed at the same events.
- **KI/KI** is another name often mentioned alongside VTSS. She has risen in parallel to VTSS (even performing B2B with her). With an Instagram following of about **275K** , KI/KI has attracted many of the same young rave fans who crave fast-paced, euphoric sets. Observing social media, one finds many followers in common between VTSS and KI/KI – and collaboration videos (like their Boiler Room back-to-back) drew collective fanbases together.
- Beyond these, fans often engage with artists in adjacent genres/scenes:
    - **In the harder techno realm**: **Amelie Lens** and **Charlotte de Witte** are two big-room techno stars that some VTSS fans also follow, though these Belgian DJs have more mainstream audiences. A number of VTSS fans were introduced to techno through Charlotte/Amelie and then gravitated to VTSS for a more underground flavor.)
    - **In the experimental club realm**: artists like **Gabber Modus Operandi**, **Sherelle**, or **Bonzai** might be on the radar of VTSS’s more adventurous fans, given VTSS’s willingness to incorporate breakbeats and cross-genre elements.
- VTSS’s audience is part of a broader subculture that follows a constellation of DJs pushing the envelope of techno/EBM.
- To summarize, VTSS’s fans typically also engage with artists like *I Hate Models, Kobosil, Héctor Oaks, Dax J, Randomer, LSDXOXO,* and *KI/KI*, among others. These overlapping fanbases interact in online forums and at events, often rallying around the same anthems and values (e.g. love of “hard and fast” music, an appreciation for experimental twists).

### **Aesthetic, Visual Identity & Creative Approach**

Her **aesthetic and visual identity** play a significant role in her brand and in how fans connect with her

- At her core, VTSS embodies a **bold, high-octane club aesthetic**. She’s known for blending the gritty underground rave look with touches of high fashion. As *Mixmag* described, VTSS keeps “one foot in the ‘big room’ and another in the avant-garde,” equally at home commanding the colossal sound systems of a festival as she is *“soundtracking a high fashion party in Milan”* . This duality is evident in her visual presentation:
    - On stage, she often sports edgy, utilitarian clubwear – think combat boots, leather, spikes, and futuristic sunglasses – exuding an image of the **“uncompromising queen of the rave”** . Fans at shows sometimes mirror her style, wearing black harnesses or DIY rave outfits, effectively creating a shared visual language in the crowd.
    - She’s also walked the runway for Diesel at Milan Fashion Week. This **fashion-forward credibility** gives her a unique edge; fans who follow style trends see her as a tastemaker DJ merging music and design.
- Her visual identity often carries themes of **rebellion, futurism, and empowerment**. The artwork for her releases – such as the *Circulus Vitiosus* EP – features distorted, surreal imagery, reflecting her “vicious circle” moniker (VTSS itself is derived from *“vitiosus,” Latin for vicious* ). **She frequently uses stark color palettes (lots of black, neon accents) and bold typography in tour posters**. All these elements create a **recognizable brand** that fans can latch onto. It’s common to see fan-made graphics or tattoos inspired by VTSS logos and visuals.
- **The way VTSS’s aesthetic influences fan connection is significant:**
    - **Identity and Inclusivity:** VTSS presents herself with a confident, androgynous style – sometimes glam, sometimes tomboyish – which many fans, especially young women and LGBTQ+ community, find empowering. Fans often comment that they appreciate her “realness” and that she represents the cool, creative outsider.
    - **Visual Storytelling:** Through her music videos and stage production, VTSS extends her music’s narrative visually. For example, in the video for “Make You Scream,” she used intense strobe lighting and chaotic camera work to evoke the frenzy of a rave (garnering excited YouTube comments from fans who felt the video *“captured the track’s energy perfectly”*). During live sets, her lighting and backdrop choices – often staccato strobes and smoky darkness – create an immersive environment that fans rave about experiencing. It’s not just a DJ set; it’s a **full sensory assault**, and fans connect with the atmosphere she builds as much as the music.
    - **High-Art Meets Rave Culture:** VTSS is frequently photographed in magazines (like 032c and Dazed) with conceptual styling. This positions her as more than a DJ – she’s a **cultural figure** blurring art, fashion, and music.
- In essence, VTSS’s visual identity – **edgy yet authentic**, **fashion-conscious yet rooted in rave** – significantly **enhances fan connection**. It gives fans symbols to rally around and reinforces the messages in her music (freedom, intensity, subversion). By staying true to a coherent aesthetic that crosses creative domains, she has made herself instantly recognizable. This not only strengthens brand loyalty among existing fans but also attracts attention from potential fans who encounter her striking image and get curious about the artist behind it.

### **Musical Themes and Resonant Content**

- VTSS’s tracks and sets hit a nerve for fans looking for intensity, innovation, and even emotional release:
    - **High-Speed Energy:** Perhaps the most immediately obvious trait – VTSS’s fans *love how hard and fast she goes*. Her music often sits in the 140-150 BPM range, with relentless percussion. Tracks like **“Make You Scream”** exemplify this. On forums, you’ll see comments like “this track makes me want to run through walls” or fans posting workout videos soundtracked by VTSS’s uptempo songs. The theme of **unbridled energy** is central – it’s music to sweat to, to rage to, and fans embrace it as a source of excitement and empowerment.
    - **Hard, Industrial Sounds with a Twist:** VTSS’s style incorporates industrial techno and EBM (Electronic Body Music) influences – pounding kick drums, distorted synths, and at times, aggressive noise elements. Fans who grew up on harder genres resonate with how she *“marries demonic industrial techno with EBM, sped-up trance and hardcore”*, as DJ Mag put it . What makes it special is the **unpredictability** she brings. In a single set, she might weave from a warehouse techno banger into a cheeky trance melody or a breakbeat flip. This keeps fans on their toes. Many cite her **“unpredictable selections”**  as something that sets her apart – there’s always a surprise or a fresh element, preventing monotony. Fans love that she doesn’t stick to a formula but still maintains a signature intensity.
    - **Anthems of Rebellion and Fun:** Despite (or because of) the hard aesthetic, there’s a sense of fun in some of VTSS’s output that fans latch onto. For instance, her track **“Sick Bitch” (VTSS Remix)** – originally a song by Shygirl – became a fan favorite because it combined a sassy, empowering vocal hook with VTSS’s dark techno flair. It’s the kind of track that makes people smirk and dance with extra attitude. Similarly, her song titles like *“Notoriously Fast”* or *“Body Mind Hell”* carry a wink and swagger that fans enjoy quoting. **The theme of *rebellion* – doing things her own way** – comes through in these tracks and resonates especially with younger fans who see her as breaking norms (be it genre norms or societal ones).
    - **Emotional Undercurrents:** Beneath the toughness, some of VTSS’s music has emotional depth that fans connect with on a personal level. She has tracks that invoke feelings of nostalgia or melancholy amid the chaos (for example, an unreleased VTSS edit of a ’90s trance vocal circulated in her sets). Fans have commented that certain VTSS pieces make them *“feel a weird euphoria”* or that there’s “soul in the machines.” **As her style evolves, especially with her recent pivot to include more melodic or “poppy” elements, fans are picking up on a broader emotional range**. The **EP “Projections”** marked a slightly new chapter, with tracks like **“Trust Me”** at a slower tempo (sub-110 BPM) with nuanced, hypnotic elements. **VTSS said this was a result of newfound courage to explore subtlety**.
    - **Live Set Content:** A final aspect of content that VTSS fans geek out over is the array of **exclusive edits and IDs** in her live sets. She often plays unreleased material (from herself or her friends) and inventive mashups (e.g., layering a classic trance vocal over a modern techno beat). Fans on Reddit and SoundCloud hunt for these IDs. The fact that she curates such unique setlists is a theme in itself that resonates: **novelty and discovery**. Her followers take pride in being part of those in-the-know who heard a crazy new VTSS edit before it’s out. This drives a kind of scavenger hunt culture, bonding fans as they share recordings and collectively identify tracks. It’s an interactive dimension to her music consumption that fans find exciting and rewarding.
- **In summary:** **the content VTSS fans resonate with most is the content that makes them feel alive and part of a movement**. Be it the kinetic energy of her fastest techno assaults, the clever genre-bends and attitude-laden anthems, or the deeper emotional and communal threads in her sets. The **themes of high energy**, **defiance**, **surprise**, and even a touch of emotion are what keep her audience coming back for more, eager to hear how she’ll raise the bar next.

### **Growth Milestones and Viral Moments**

- VTSS’s journey from an underground DJ in Warsaw to an internationally acclaimed artist has been marked by **significant growth spurts** – moments where her following and media exposure leaped forward. **By examining these spikes in followers, streams, and attention, and correlating them with what VTSS was doing at the time, we can identify what propelled her popularity.**
    - **Late 2021 – Early 2022: Breakout Releases and Press**. VTSS’s signing with Ninja Tune’s Technicolour imprint and the release of her *“Projections”* EP were pivotal.
        - The Insomniac artist profile from that period highlights this as a “new chapter” . The EP and its lead single “Trust Me” garnered reviews and likely drew in a more diverse listener base (including more casual electronic fans curious about Ninja Tune artists).
        - Around the same time, her *Mixmag* cover story (“I want it all”) positioned her as a leading light in techno’s new wave, exposing her to a global audience of readers.
        - These activities correlated with steady follower increases. By mid-2022, VTSS had solidified her presence beyond the underground, as evidenced by a **jump in Spotify listeners** as well.
    - **Summer 2022: Festival Circuit & Viral Set Moments.** 2022 was the year VTSS hit major festivals, which translated into follower bumps and media buzz. She played at **Dekmantel Festival (NL)** and had a standout set at **Unsound (PL)** that year, among others. A particular milestone was her set at **Primavera Sound Barcelona 2022** – being on a lineup with mainstream acts meant exposure to thousands of new ears. According to Viberate analytics, she later also performed at **Creamfields North and Glastonbury**.
    - **2023: Collaboration and Crossover Appeal.** In 2023, VTSS achieved new visibility through collaborations and. She teamed up with **Boys Noize** on the track *“Steady Pace”* (Big Beat/Atlantic). This release had a wider commercial push and introduced VTSS to the Boys Noize fanbase and the **broader electro/techno-pop crowd**. Consequently, her streaming numbers spiked and her social following grew steadily as listeners searched who VTSS was. Additionally, late 2023 saw her remix **Shygirl** – a move noted by outlets as a pivot “towards producing tracks that are undeniably poppy”. That remix (of “Shlut”) went somewhat viral in **alt-pop and hyperpop circles**, giving VTSS an entrée into a fresh demographic (Shygirl’s fans, more pop-leaning, many of whom followed VTSS after hearing the remix). Each of these musical milestones came with media coverage and fan chatter, translating into visible growth online.
    - **2024: Mainstage Moments and Media Attention.** By 2024, VTSS’s trajectory hit new highs. A major moment was her scheduled **closing set at Sónar Festival 2024** (Barcelona), on the main stage. This was widely advertised and **affirmed her headliner status**. Around the same time, she had **features in high-profile media like *032c* magazine**  (with an in-depth interview in June 2024) and ***Interview Magazine***. These media spotlights not only validated her artistry to industry watchers but also attracted new fans who read about her story and checked out her music. Social metrics from mid-2024 show likely upticks corresponding to these events. Another growth jolt came from her expanding into **North America** – she toured U.S. clubs and made her debut at events like **CRSSD Fest in California** and **Piknic Électronik Montréal** (early 2025) as well as the ultimate stage: **Coachella 2025**. The Coachella booking was announced in early 2025 and immediately led to a flurry of social media mentions. Many U.S. festival-goers looked her up, and one can infer a follower boost around that announcement (as hinted by Chartmetric’s Feb 17, 2025 stat anomaly , which was just after Coachella’s lineup release and her own teasing of “VTSSCHELLA”).
    - A look at Chartmetric data shows that on a single day – Feb 17, 2025 – VTSS gained 722 new Instagram followers, a **65.6% increase over her usual daily growth rate**
    - **Recap of Key Growth Moments:**

    - Each spike was tied to **specific activities – new music that caught on, performances that went viral, or media coverage that expanded awareness**. **This illustrates how VTSS’s growth has been momentum-driven: she converts big opportunities and moments into sustained fan acquisition. Her ability to capitalize on both underground credibility *and* mainstream platforms (like Coachella) is cementing her status as a rising star with an ever-growing following.**

**Geographic Reach and Key Territories**
VTSS’s following is truly global, but certain **key territories and markets** have emerged where her support is strongest and her impact most pronounced. These “VTSS strongholds” align with her touring history and cultural connections:

- **Europe – The Core Fanbase:** Being Polish-born and Europe-based, VTSS naturally has her largest and most concentrated fanbase across Europe. Within Europe:
    - **Poland:** holds a special segment of her fanbase. She came up through Warsaw’s underground (Brutaż parties). She’s headlined events like Unsound in Kraków, and her Polish fan community is tight-knit (lots of Polish-language chatter on forums and social media).
    - **United Kingdom:** has built a strong following in the UK. London is effectively her second home and one of her top markets. She’s a regular at clubs like Fabric and was at Printworks, and has played UK festivals (Junction 2, Creamfields, Glastonbury) that massively expanded her reach. UK press (Mixmag, DJ Mag, BBC Radio 1) has championed her, which has translated to a strong British fanbase.
    - **Germany:** **Berlin** (where she lived for years, #3 for Monthly Listeners on Spotify) and Germany at large form another key territory. VTSS cut her teeth in Berlin’s clubs, and German techno fans embraced her early. Legendary venue **Berghain** in Berlin was one of the first international spots she conquered, and that cachet still draws German fans to her. While Berlin’s scene is saturated with DJs, VTSS managed to stand out by “pushing against strictly imposed boundaries of the city’s techno scene”. Thus, she has a loyal following in Germany, especially among those who like the harder, boundary-pushing style.
    - **Netherlands & Belgium:** The Benelux region is another strong zone, given the popularity of hard techno there. Appearances at **Amsterdam**’s clubs (De School, etc.) and festivals like Dekmantel cemented her Dutch fanbase. **Belgium**, with its love for techno (Tomorrowland, Fuse club), has also embraced her – plus the overlap with fans of Amelie Lens/Charlotte (both Belgian) means spillover interest in VTSS.
    - **France and Southern Europe:** While slightly less central, VTSS has notable presence in **France** (she’s played Concrete in Paris and Peacock Society festival) and Spain (Sónar **Barcelona** gave her a major platform in 2024, and she also played at clubs like Razzmatazz). Southern European fans appreciate her hardcore-meets-funky style; for instance, in **Italy** she’s been billed at festivals like Kappa Futur, and in Spain, **after Sónar, her social media saw an uptick in Spanish-language comments praising her set**.
- In Europe overall, **VTSS is seen as one of the new leaders of the techno underground**, and her following reflects that across the continent. Virtually every major European city with a techno scene has a pocket of VTSS fans.
- **North America – Growing Rapidly:** Initially, VTSS’s presence in North America was minimal, but that changed in the last couple of years:
    - **United States:** Started touring the U.S. around 2022 and especially 2023. Cities like **New York** (New York #5 city for Monthly Listeners on Spotify) and **Los Angeles** (Los Angeles #1 for Monthly Listeners on Spotify) with burgeoning techno/club scenes that took to her sound. She played warehouse parties in **NYC** and gained a cult following there (**The Lot Radio featured her early on, for instance)**. On the West Coast, festivals such as CRSSD **(San Diego**) and club nights in **Los Angeles** introduced her to American ravers. The big breakthrough is **Coachella 2025** – performing there puts her in front of a broad U.S. audience and significantly raises her profile stateside. After the Coachella lineup drop, many U.S. music outlets included VTSS in “**acts you can’t miss”** lists**.**
    - **Canada:** She’s made inroads in Canada. In **Montreal**’s Piknic Électronik series, her 2025 set was highly promoted . Montreal and Toronto both have strong techno communities, and her appearances there (and at Bass Coast festival in BC) garnered a lot of interest. Canadian fans often align with European taste, so VTSS’s style was readily appreciated.
- **Other Territories:**
    - **Latin America:** Some indication of interest in Latin America (for example, she played at Comunité in Tulum, Mexico in early 2023, and her name has popped up on lineups in Bogotá and São Paulo). While not her primary market yet, the global techno network means she’s gaining fans in those regions as well. Festivals like EDC Mexico have featured similar artists (like I Hate Models), which can cross-pollinate fanbases; a noted Instagram post even showed her alongside other techno acts at EDC Mexico 2025 . So, territories like **Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia** are emerging markets for her, especially among the underground club scenes.
    - **Asia & Oceania:** VTSS has toured in Australia (playing Melbourne and Sydney small festivals) and likely picked up fan pockets there (Australia’s love for high-energy acts means she was well received – Melbourne #2 city for Monthly Listeners on Spotify). In Asia, she’s played gigs in **Seoul and Tokyo** in late 2022 and 2023. These areas remain growth frontiers – not her largest followings yet, but with definite interest. Online, you’ll occasionally see comments in Korean or Japanese on her YouTube videos, suggesting an attentive niche audience in East Asia.
- **Geographic Reach and Key Territories In summary**:
    - **Europe (especially UK, Poland, Germany, Netherlands, Spain)** – where she rose to prominence and continues to be a major draw.
    - **North America (USA & Canada)** – rapidly growing after recent tours and festival plays.
    - Other regions (Latin America, Asia-Pacific) – smaller but growing scenes of fans, often connected via global festival circuits.
    - Each territory has its nuances (e.g., UK fans might interact more on Twitter, Polish fans on local forums, Americans on Instagram/TikTok), but collectively they reinforce that VTSS has successfully transitioned from a local European phenomenon to an artist with a **worldwide following**. She now has the challenge and opportunity of nurturing those audiences further, possibly tailoring content or tours to keep momentum in each region.

### **Comparative Context: Similar Artists’ Audiences & Fan Culture**

To put VTSS’s audience and positioning in context, it’s helpful to compare her with a few similar artists and examine differences and similarities in fan behavior and culture. Looking at two categories: ***peer artists with an underground cult following*** and ***artists who have broken into a more mainstream tier***, and see how VTSS sits relative to them.

- **Peers in the Underground / Experimental Techno Scene:**
    - **LSDXOXO:** Both artists emerged as part of a forward-thinking club music wave, often playing on the same lineups. LSDXOXO, like VTSS, blends genres (techno with ballroom/vogue and pop edits) and has a very online-savvy persona. His fan culture is notably queer-friendly, meme-driven, and interactive – he posts humorous content and fans respond in kind. With ~70K Instagram followers , LSDXOXO’s following is smaller than VTSS’s, but the **engagement is high**: his fans are vocal on Twitter and create inside jokes (for instance, referencing lyrics of his in meme formats). Compared to VTSS, LSDXOXO’s fans might be slightly more niche in that they are heavily concentrated in the queer club community and in cities like New York/Berlin. **VTSS’s fanbase, while overlapping significantly, is a bit broader (she pulls in more of the straight techno bros along with the art-ravers**). Both artists emphasize approachability online, but LSDXOXO often uses humor and sexuality overtly as part of the act, whereas VTSS balances edgy cool with occasional silliness. In positioning, VTSS and LSDXOXO are seen as mutual rising stars; however, VTSS has pulled slightly ahead in terms of follower numbers and mainstream festival bookings (Coachella, etc.), while LSDXOXO remains a club circuit favorite.
    - **KI/KI:** KI/KI from the Netherlands shares a similar trajectory to VTSS. Both champion a 90s-influenced rave sound and rose quickly since late 2010s. KI/KI’s audience (~275K Instagram followers , nearly as large as VTSS’s) is concentrated in Europe’s trance/techno revival crowd. **Fan behavior for KI/KI is quite similar to VTSS – passionate comments on her set videos, strong turnout at festival stages, and lots of word-of-mouth hype**. One difference is **KI/KI’s branding leans into a slightly more *retro-rave* aesthetic (she often references classic trance motifs**), which attracts fans who are nostalgic or newly enamored with that era. **VTSS’s aesthetic is darker and more industrial** by comparison. In terms of audience, one might say KI/KI’s fans are the “trancey ravers” while VTSS’s are the “techno punks,” but in practice there’s huge crossover. They often play B2B and their fan communities merge at those events – a synergy both have benefited from. **If KI/KI’s fan culture is about PLUR and euphoria, VTSS’s is about energy and attitude, yet both artists foster inclusive, PLUR-friendly environments**. Position-wise, they are peers and often mentioned together as leading female DJs of their scene; VTSS may have a slight edge in media spotlight recently, whereas KI/KI is a staple in the European festival circuit.
    - **I Hate Models:** Although stylistically a bit different (more melodic and emotional in his approach to industrial techno), I Hate Models serves as a good contrast in audience culture. IHM has an *enormous* fanbase in hard techno – nearly **1 million Instagram followers** , far exceeding VTSS’s count. His fan culture is almost rock-star-like: extremely devoted, with fans traveling long distances to see him, wearing merch (his “Forever Young” and other slogans), and flooding comment sections. For instance, an I Hate Models Instagram post can get thousands of comments, something usually only seen with mainstream acts . In comparison, VTSS’s fans are active but not to that volume – her posts get a few hundred comments on average, not thousands. This indicates IHM has hit a nerve in the mass festival market that VTSS is just entering now. Moreover, IHM maintains a bit of mystique (rarely shows his face clearly, a persona of the “lonesome raver”), whereas VTSS is very accessible. This leads to differences: IHM’s fans sometimes engage in hero-worship, while VTSS’s fans feel like they’re friends with her. The **audience behavior** for IHM shows more idolization, whereas for **VTSS it’s more community-oriented**. Position-wise, IHM is an example of an underground artist who became a top-billed international headliner quickly; VTSS could be on a similar trajectory but her approach (and thus fan culture) might remain more grounded and personal.
- **Mainstream Techno Headliners:**
    - **Charlotte de Witte and Amelie Lens:** Charlotte and Amelie **represent the current pinnacle of mainstream techno DJs**, each with multi-million followings (Charlotte has 4M on IG ). Comparing VTSS to Charlotte/Amelie provides perspective on scale and fanbase nature. Charlotte de Witte’s fanbase is huge and global – her fans pack massive stages and she’s a brand unto herself (own label KNTXT, etc.). **Fan behavior there includes intense devotion, but also a more general EDM-like fandom (her reach extends to casual festival-goers who might not be techno purists)**. VTSS’s fanbase is smaller and more niche by comparison, but also **more subculturally rooted**. Charlotte’s social media posts might garner tens of thousands of likes from a broad audience, while VTSS’s get a few thousand likes largely from core scene followers. Culturally, Charlotte’s and Amelie’s fan communities have sometimes been critiqued for bandwagon behavior (some techno purists argue their popularity brings in “tourist” fans). VTSS’s fans, on the other hand, often pride themselves on having found an artist who remains authentic and not “selling out.” This gives VTSS a certain credibility – **her fan culture is closer to a grassroots movement**, whereas Charlotte’s is a mainstream fandom. In positioning, VTSS is still on the come-up to that level; she’s playing similar festivals but in earlier slots or smaller stages.
    - **Nina Kraviz (as a case study):** Another comparison is Nina Kraviz, who, like VTSS, crossed from underground to mainstream but faced some community challenges. Nina built a persona and had a very engaged fanbase, but controversies in recent years affected her standing. **VTSS has often been contrasted as a new-gen artist who is vocal about social issues and scene ethics** (where Nina was seen as apolitical), **which appeals to many younger fans**. Thus VTSS’s fan culture might be more resilient and values-driven. It’s worth noting because it shows how artists’ approaches (beyond music) shape their audience. VTSS, by being open about her stance (feminism, diversity in techno), has attracted fans that align with those values and will likely stick with her, whereas Nina’s fanbase splintered when those values came into question.
- In conclusion, **VTSS sits in a middle ground** between the underground peers and the mainstream techno stars:
    - She shares with her peers (LSDXOXO, KI/KI, etc.) **a community-based, highly engaged fan culture that thrives on authenticity and direct interaction**. Like them, she’s seen as part of the “cool underground,” and fans revel in being part of that circle.
    - Relative to the mainstream stars (Charlotte, Amelie), her **fanbase is smaller and more specialized, but arguably more passionately interconnected**. VTSS hasn’t yet hit the massive commercial popularity – which is a good thing for some fans who prefer the intimacy of her shows and online interactions.
