### Ideas

### Journey of information from one fan to another

- book idea of nominating and passing on – can’t recall name (hands across the world)
    - each submission is collated and made into a zine to be sole with the album
- Refs: BeReal and [Minutiae](https://minutiae-app.org/)

### Daily stoic – a message from Kamal each day / every 2 days / every week

- Ref: [Creative Independent](https://www.instagram.com/p/DHlUq59O_l-/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link), Daily Stoic
- Ongoing AMA:
    - Ref: [Red Hand Files](https://www.theredhandfiles.com/)
    - Reddit so more opportunity for discussion, pinned
    - Silent mood board: fans upload images they’ve taken that best reflect their connection to the songs. Could be Pinterest or some other medium to submit. Finsta that we share as the album drops but have collected throughout the album campaign

### Self-therapy

- Ref: [Fashion Neurosis / Bella Freud](https://www.instagram.com/fashionneurosis_bellafreud/)
- Self-medicating, good or bad?

### Live streams

no one wants to go back to Covid but there is something about the connection and bond achieved with his fans during that period. Nocturnal / night time content and engagements, how can this be done globally to reflect timezones and an always-on-nighttime live stream for example?

### After the party: what happens?

- Kamal asks a series of questions related to the songs themes and lyrics to inspire engagement. Fans won’t know the questions are related until the songs / album is released

### Targets

- A View From a Bridge
- [At the Beep](https://www.instagram.com/p/CxRmyNSOU97/)
- Shit You Should Care About

### Dual algorithm experience experiment:

- Two phones side by side
- each account has a pre-defined persona
    - 18 year old male based in the UK
    - 18 year old girl based in the UK
- define the likes of each and track what content they’re exposed to based on a series of repetitive likes
- track the diversity of content
    - a video about football and then served a video about misogyny
- [Context Reference](https://www.instagram.com/p/C_bbRQOMc_0/)
- Could we expose an AI to each of these types of content, one bad and one good and then test for how it effects their responses after a week? Will it not matter because they don’t have emotions?

### Good News or Bad News

- Predicated on the blue pill / red pill theory
- We present a website that depending on your selection of Good or Bad, you’re exposed to a curated feed of stories from a number of news sites
- This idea could be an extension of the above dual algo experiment
- Living Space
    - Fans share photos of their sanctuary (their bedrooms?) where they feel at most comfortable with their thoughts
    - Refs: [Male Living Space](https://www.reddit.com/r/malelivingspace/) / [IG](https://www.instagram.com/p/C3-yoPIpgeG/?img_index=1) (Reddit, 2.5m)

### Desensitisation Adverts

- series of ads featuring Kamal (or a model) seemingly at important events, whether in history or perhaps just general moments of importance (friend’s wedding / birthday, important speech, football game, intimacy) but while those around them are engaged in what is happening, the actor is looking at their phone
- Ref. [Nintendo ads in the 90s](https://www.instagram.com/p/C3JdE9kJk5n/?img_index=1),

### What does it mean to be young?

- Why we should go easy on today’s youth
    - “since you turned 18 the world has…” we list out a few facts that have happened on a number of levels (social, political, financial, technological, sexual)
    - should be catered to a few prefixes such as country, gender (if identified)
    - We then use this to rewind another generation to remind the person who turned 18 using the tool as to what it was like when they were 18 and everything that had happened in the years between their parent’s youth and then them turning 18
- Reference: [Time Flies When You’re Billie Eilish](https://www.instagram.com/p/CW7UAUxllvD/)

### Advertisements

- Series of ads about freedom:
    - “free me from my self”
    - “free me from my feed”
- “It was better in my day”
    - we list out the reasons why that isn’t a thing to be proud of because of what is being done to the world
    - Other sayings to prefix:
        - “back in my day…”
        - “the problem with the youth of today is…”
        - “when I was young…”
- “scared? feeling restless? worried about the future? Age knows no [something???]”
- What does it mean to be young?
    - highlight something bad happening in the world and then highlight what is expected of people because of the previous generation’s shaping of culture

### Live

- what can we do at each stop on the tour?
- can we host Q&As (reminder about previous studio hang needed

### Album Playbacks

- Kamal listening posts.

## Questions

- How do we foster more community amongst Kamal’s fans
- How can those fans interact with one another independent of Kamal?
- How can we illustrate what it means to be young today? How do we connect that with people of all ages?

On forums like r/UKmusic, users discussing Dave’s *“Mercury”* noted Kamal. as a highlight, and some Dave fans started following Kamal.’s solo work thereafter

Additionally, Kamal. cites influences from Radiohead to neo-soul , and intriguingly, some fans of **alternative/indie bands** have found their way to Kamal. Perhaps due to the acoustic and indie-folk elements in some of his songs, he has a minor overlapping fanbase with artists like **Beabadoobee**

**localized, modest visual approach sets Kamal. apart** in an era of flashy pop visuals, and it strengthens fans’ perception of him as a genuine person.

Kamal.’s visuals are carefully crafted to be *honest and artful but never overproduced*, a balance that his fans find very appealing.

In summary, **Kamal.’s aesthetic and persona work in harmony with his music**. The visuals are intimate and real, the messaging is heartfelt and humble, and the man himself comes across as the embodiment of the gentle, reflective spirit in his songs. This coherence strengthens fans’ trust in his artistry – they feel that the Kamal. they hear in headphones is the Kamal. they see in videos and interviews. For the fan community, this integrity is a big part of why they invest emotionally in him.

**Loneliness and Social Anxiety:** Kamal. has captured the modern youthful sense of isolation perhaps better than any of his UK peers. **“Homebody”** remains the quintessential example – its theme of preferring solitude over social scenes not only became a lockdown anthem but a generational mood

*I can’t be myself in crowds”* spoke to countless fans who felt out of place in social settings . This honest depiction of social anxiety continued in songs like **“About the Party”**, where he details the unease of being at a party wishing you were home

It’s common to see comments like “*this song understands my depression*” or tweets stating that Kamal.’s music helped them through anxiety attacks. The theme of **hurt people hurting people** (as in his 2024 single **“hurt people”**) also struck a chord – Kamal. *“digs deep on ‘Hurt People’ – a song about unpicking trauma, and accepting your emotions”* , which fans and outlets praised for its candor. Each time Kamal. addresses mental or emotional struggles head-on, it sparks a wave of appreciative engagement as fans feel seen.

*“loneliness and young love”*, essentially the trials of adolescence and early adulthood 

his track **“lose”** did get some TikTok traction as a sound for reflective videos, which may have provided mini-spikes in streaming and TikTok follower count whenever a video using it went moderately viral.

In late 2024, he hinted at an album in the works (selling *“single files”* vinyl and writing a letter to fans in Dec 2024

**United Kingdom (Home Base):** As expected, the UK – and London in particular – is a major stronghold for Kamal. Many of his earliest fans are Londoners who resonated with his authentic portrayal of their city life. **London is among his top cities on Spotify** with around 14.5K monthly listeners

**Southeast Asia (Surprisingly Large Audience):** One of the most remarkable aspects of Kamal.’s fanbase is his strong following in Southeast Asia. Streaming analytics show **Jakarta, Indonesia as his top city worldwide** – with about 21.9K listeners, even more than London

**North America:** The U.S. and Canada are emerging territories for Kamal. While initially his presence was minimal, it’s growing thanks to the internet and his recent label maneuvers. By early 2025, North America is not yet in his top cities (no U.S. city in the top 5 per Spotify), but it’s on the rise

In conclusion, **Kamal.’s strongest fan territories** are the UK (his foundation), parts of Europe/Australia (culturally aligned English-speaking markets), and notably Southeast Asia (where youthful audiences have embraced his music en masse). He also enjoys pockets of fandom in North America and beyond, which are likely to expand. This worldwide engagement speaks to the universality of his themes – regardless of locale, listeners connect to loneliness, love, and longing – and Kamal.’s gentle sound crosses language barriers. For Kamal., leaning into this global appeal (perhaps via localized social content or eventually international touring supported by data showing where demand is) will be key
