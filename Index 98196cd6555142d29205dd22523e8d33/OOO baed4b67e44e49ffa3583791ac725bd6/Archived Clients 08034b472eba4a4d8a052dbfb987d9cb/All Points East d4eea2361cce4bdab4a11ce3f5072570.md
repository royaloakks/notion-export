We want the festival to be in the fabric of music fans in and the surrounding areas of London. 

How do we achieve that?

Through agency. 

So much of the marketing job is wrapped up in the experience itself. Logistical issues like sound, lineup clashes, queues, toilets, need to be resolved to ensure an experience worth talking about

### OVERVIEW

How do we present and establish All Points East as an unmissable and culturally rich music festival to be a fixed point in the calendar of music fans?

Based on our brief discussions to date the following is a snapshot of thoughts and ideas. There are numerous areas of expansion and further discussion as to how we can work to achieve this objective. 

---

### FANS

We believe empowering fanbases and creating agency is the strongest form of marketing. Word of mouth is by no means a revolutionary concept but has increasingly become an afterthought in favour of broad and meaningless social media outreach and advertising.

We want to identify those repeat APE attendees and create agency; incentivise them with advance offers on tickets or on-site rewards such as free drinks or special access. Other initial ideas include:

**Gamification**

Commission a pictorial representation of the APE lineup where fans can guess who is playing. The fan with the most correct answers can win tickets. This inevitably enlists fans to joint together to solve the puzzle therefore increasing the opportunity for the word to spread.

**Fan Curation**

The ultimate fan empowerment is the feeling of being seen and heard – is there scope for fan’s input into the lineup? A call to action where fans can openly suggest and vote for their favourite artist to play APE. The likelihood is that fans will suggest artists that are already confirmed to play but the action of fans submitting, which creates engagement, and then being able to be rewarded with confirmation they were successful, even if only an illusion, will create greater ownership of the fan over the festival and experience. Marketing is the story people tell themselves, not what they are told.

**Fan Line-Up Announcements**

**Postcards**

Where we have data on those who are repeat attendees we prioritise them  post a letter in advance of an artist announcement so they’re the first to know and share the news.

**Spotify**

Spotify’s Fan First program is well established for tours. We propose a partnership where Spotify target the top fan(s) in the UK of select artist’s on the lineup to reveal them playing APE along with an incentive such as reduce admission tickets.

### ALL POINTS EAST ~~FESTIVAL?~~

It’s easy for APE to be positioned as a traditional festival in people’s minds given the nature of the setup and branding to date. However, with the diverse range of headliners, the London location and lack of camping, it leans towards a series of all-dayers more so than an overall festival experience. Naturally there are a number of festivals with diverse lineups and while we don’t necessarily think there’s a particular need to take a radical repositioning of APE away from being considered a festival, it does present obstacles in how APE is marketed. cont —>

### 6 x MARKETING STRATEGIES

—> It is in this observation that we begin considering our approach; adopting the belief much like a record label is only as strong as it’s  roster, a festival is only as strong as its lineup. The diverse headliners and supporting artists, and one-day nature of the events means we need to adapt our marketing strategy to be tailored to each day and the fanbases of these artists. Artists are looking for ways to engage with their fans in exciting and unexpected ways. We will endeavour to establish a series of activations and methods that empower the artists to motivate their fans to move in the name of All Points East.

---

### ANNOUNCEMENT —> TICKET PURCHASE —> FESTIVAL

An artist’s typical focus is on THEIR album release or THEIR tour, not that of a festival, usually one of many they’re playing throughout the year across a number of territories. We need to centre APE in the hearts and minds of the artist in which to be the advocate of the festival to their fans. This ownership will create a loyalty and help us sustain the marketing from announcement through to the festival.

---

### SATELLITE SHOWS

One of the key obstacles is maintaining visibility during the chasm of time between announcement and festival. We need to establish tent-pole moments strategically through this period that provide the opportunity for APE to be marketing to the ticket buying audience. We propose establishing a series of satellite DJ parties in London (and possibly surrounding areas based on sales data), featuring artists on the line up. These utilise the artists from APE as a direct connection back to the festival and provide a number of opportunities to market the festival to the attending audience, such as:

- Free attendance to those who have already purchased an APE ticket (limited window to claim)
- Allocation of tickets to artists performing to giveaway to their fans
- Data collection for future marketing communications
- Content creation for APE and artist socials channels

---

### YOUTUBE CHANNEL

Depending upon the extent we can build a comprehensive schedule of these satellite shows throughout the period through to the festival we should consider starting a new dedicated APE YouTube channel in the spirit of Boiler Room and The Lot Radio for example. We can live stream the shows and / or upload following the events. 

Alternatively we could consider approaching an already established channel in which to partner with. This would allow us to tap into the preexisting audience for alignment and relieve the heavier lifting of growing the channel. More discussion here as to the pros and cons to either scenario but a good option in which to extend the visibility of the shows and brand. 

---

### ALL POINTS EAST x HEADLINER MERCH

Partnering with select top-tier artists to produce one-off limited merch as giveaways to their fans. The exclusivity of these pieces will be  available only to those fans that have purchased APE tickets for the day when the artist is performing. Their will be an active window period when this is announced through to the giveaway, allowing for fans who haven’t already purchased to secure tickets for the entry into the prize draw.

- Artist is incentivised as they get to engage with their fanbase on something unique and exclusive
- Artist and/or label to share in data capture
- Fans are engaged because it’s an artist they’re a fan of and
- APE benefits from on-shirt branding, data capture and ticket sales

---

### CONTENT THROWBACK

While traditional digital advertising has its place we propose a strategic plan of highlighting preexisting and already [performing content on TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/search?q=All%20Points%20East&t=1697817121350). We have previously worked closely with the newly established co:brand agency and their advanced tools in identifying content to boost within TikTok. Budget spend here is significantly optimised and while we’re using already performed content the algorithm has a dataset for this to be resurfaced. 

Spend here should be timed around lineup announcements and to run alongside other key marketing activations going live. While the content is of course from previous years and artists who aren’t playing 2024, the nostalgia of these moments can act as a strong motivator in returning festival fans.

### Questions

- What customer data do we have and methods for communication at our disposal?
- How do we create agency for APE fans? How can we empower them to share to others?
- What’s the geographic breakdown of APE fans? How do we facilitate their journey? Are there international packages?
- How does the APE experience journey start with the ticket purchase if that is months before APE takes place?
- On-site experience: Access and queues, staff, help and support, [sound issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheStrokes/comments/161flkf/all_points_east_was_a_huge_disappointment/) – experience on the day is arguably a significant influence alongside the lineup and as to whether people repeat attend an event.
- As above – what can we learn from previous logistics issues to better serve the fan’s on-site experience?
- What’s the ticketing payment plans – early bird, instalments, group purchases, repeat-purchase percentage?
