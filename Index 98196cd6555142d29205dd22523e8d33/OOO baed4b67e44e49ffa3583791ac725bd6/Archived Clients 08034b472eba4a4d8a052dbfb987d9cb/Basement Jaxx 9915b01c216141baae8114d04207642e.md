### Phase 1 – Thoughts

- Audit
    - Music Tomorrow
    - Socials healthcheck
    - Mailing list
    - Tickets data
    - Shop / D2C – What’s currently in place?
    - Spotify D2C – currently merchbar
    - Bandsintown
    - Reddit analysis for market research – Patrick scraper
    - Netnogaphy – audience research
    - Instagram analysis – can Patrick automate yet?
    - Previous chart positions
- How much do we rely on nostalgia to engage and move the fans?
- Who are the audience
    - Do we need to focus on reminding people that Jaxx have hits, the familiarity between the tracks albeit sonically different should now be apparent and addressed with the Singles release 20 years ago
- What fan and audience objective are we trying to achieve? Preaching to the converted or acquire new fans?
    - 100 Gecs: what happened with this release? What changed?

### Phase 1 – Ideas

- TikTok top 5 / 10 tracks content
    - Refs:
- Mailing Lists:
    - Audit and consolidate list into a provider
    - Grow and increase engagement thought incentives (mixes, BTS, archive live shows (video))
    - Merch – deadstock, repress of best sellers
    - Limited vinyl from the archive for sale / charity driver
- Mixes
    - Consolidate archive of mixes (Essential Mix etc) into a Mixcloud account
    - Schedule 1 mix every 2-4 weeks, message out to the mailing list
- Spotify
    - Update to branded artwork as opposed to relying composite track artwork
