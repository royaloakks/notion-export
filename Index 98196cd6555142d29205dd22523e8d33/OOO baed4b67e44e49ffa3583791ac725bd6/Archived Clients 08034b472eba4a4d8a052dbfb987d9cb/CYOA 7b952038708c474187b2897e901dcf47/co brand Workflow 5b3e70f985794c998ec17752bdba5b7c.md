# co:brand Workflow

### Workflow Analysis

- Are we observing creations leading to more creations? Growth in video views or engagement leading to more engagements?
- Growth of Instagram views / comments rarely, if at all, increase a creator’s followers
- BMTH: Getting ready trends. Gym trends – determine the # of videos
- What are the community hashtags?
- What is a good acceleration of views from first post?
- How quickly on average do posts surpass their creator’s media (views and engagement)
- Rules:
    - if engagement is over 10% but below the creators media engagement by no less than  1%, you boost
- Artist relative performance from single to single. Identify and set benchmarks for views and engagement as to when reposting and boosting should occur

---

### Pitch

- Daily tracking of song performance on TikTok and Instagram Reels. Measure views, likes, comments, shares and overall engagement based on creator
- Identify videos using sounds being tracked that are good candidates for boosting
- For any labels that engage influencer agencies; we add the creators engaged into a creator list to track their specific posts using the song in which to measure and provide performance results
- We identify creators in reference to a specific song as to who we would engage with on our own influencer outreach program

### To Do

- [ ]  Claire to provide release schedule of 3-4 new songs for us to monitor
- [ ]  Adam to setup spreadsheet to monitor performance
- [ ]  Create case study format for CYOA x co:brand workflow based on the songs we’re tracking and analysing

### Workflow

- Add the song to CB for tracking – ask Patrick to verify successful indexing on TT, IG, Spotify so there’s no holes in reporting
- Create a **Creator List** named after the song being tracked – this will be used to add any creators we identify whose videos are performing on the song for quicker and future reference (bookmarking)
- Create a **Segment** for the song. Albeit this is just for one song it allows you to observe the **Impactful Creators & Posts** section and add creators to the **Creator List** created above
- Daily song monitoring:
    - **Impactful Posts**: observing the header metrics of **Views**, **Likes**, **Comments**, and **Shares**
    - Sort by **Date Posted** to establish what has been posted in the previous 24 hours to establish whether anything is beginning to perform
    - **Analyze Content**: upon observing an increase in any of the aforementioned metrics, analyse the the creator / content to determine how the video is performing against the Creator’s **Media Views** and **Median Engagement**
    - If the answer to the previous point indicates the video is performing close to the **Creator’s Median Engagement**, this is a good candidate for boosting the video
    - We should establish a threshold that comes within a certain % distance of the Creator’s Median as to whether we’d consider boosting. For example, if the Creator’s Median Engagement is 8.3% and their video using our song is 6.3%, would we choose to boost then or wait until it gets closer to the 8.3% Median?
- For the sake of reporting we will bookmark videos using the song that come within a 50% threshold of the Creator’s Media Engagement purely for future review and deck purposes

**Questions**

We’re looking for High Views and High Engagement. Would we consider boosting a video with low views and high engagement? Would we consider boosting a video with high views and low engagement? Is high engagement valued more over high views?

If a video is getting 100K views but this falls below the creator’s median engagement by some margin – would we say this is a good candidate for boosting if every other video that has used the song is all below 10K views, for example?
