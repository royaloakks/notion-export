### Overview

This proposal focusses on delivering a considered release strategy for ONES‚Äô upcoming 3 singles including the bootleg edits. It works to incorporate the already exciting ideas conceived up by ONES into a cohesively deliverable release campaign and hopefully complement these ideas with some further thoughts. 

---

### Release Strategy and Timeline

**Singles**

A staggered approach to the 3 tracks, Only released in 2023, Angel and ADMiT IT released in 2024:

- Only ‚Äì November 15th
- Angel ‚Äì January 17th
- ADMiT IT ‚Äì March 1st

This approach allows ONES to maintain a frequency of momentum in order to maintain visibility as well as keep streaming monthly listeners up. 

**Edits**

The limitations of these due to sample clearances means they should be strategically placed around the core single releases. 

- Edit #1 ‚Äì November 1st (2 weeks prior to Only)
- Edit #2 ‚Äì November 29th (2 weeks after Only)
- Edit #3 ‚Äì December 13th (4 weeks after Only)
- Edit #4 ‚Äì January 10th (1 week prior to Angel)
- Edit #5 ‚Äì February 7th (3 weeks after Angel, 3 weeks prior to ADMiT IT)

While we can‚Äôt benefit from them on traditional DSPs they are important in providing a continuous stream of socials communications and ways in which to engage with fans. **Soundcloud**, **Bandcamp** and **YouTube** should all be considered platforms for the upload of these edits.

### Okay, wait

The usage of this as an ident within all of ONES‚Äô music and as a brand to extend beyond the boundaries of his music provides such a strong number of possibilities as to how you can market across visuals, advertising, merch and more. To execute this the tag should be established and utilised prominently in which to connect to back to ONES. Initially, the locations of the stickers being used should tie in with the proximity of upcoming shows, providing an opportunity for fans to connect physically with the placement and the experience of seeing ONES perform.

**Traffic Light Stickers**

The placement of these stickers will work very effectively. It‚Äôs a ubiquitous street-level utility that is constantly engaged with perfectly within context. A possible extension of this could be a custom cover of the actual top traffic light. Given the slim nature of the light it might need to be presented vertically.

![0_Tfl-Image-PN027-IWD_Green_Woman_Pedestrian_Lights_March_2021_0036 copy 2.jpeg](ONES%20465afe655ef0416fa3a08597336bb84b/0_Tfl-Image-PN027-IWD_Green_Woman_Pedestrian_Lights_March_2021_0036_copy_2.jpeg)

**The Cause**

While we might not be in a position to have the reflective traffic light stickers available it would be a a good opportunity to begin distributing a traditional version of the stickers on the route to (transport), close to and around the venue. ONES wearing a t-shirt with the same sticker on while performing helps connect it back to him, which is important for fans old and new.

**Merch**

The potential for this as a standalone brand feels really strong and an approach to one-off limited drops of apparel and items over time will build a symbiotic growth strategy for both ONES and the brand in of itself.

### ONES Mixes

As outlined by ONES there‚Äôs a number of obvious targets for radio mixes ‚Äì we‚Äôd recommend playing particular attention to community radio stations NTS, Kindred and Balamii early on. The tradition is to adopt mixes that are current in their tracklist, we‚Äôd also propose considering themed mixes such as the below examples. These could be hosted across Soundcloud, Mixcloud and / or Bandcamp.

**Remix Album**

Is there an album that ONES holds particularly close? Either as an influence on him now or as a childhood nostalgia? The latter could tie well with the maternal nature of the ***‚Äúokay, wait‚Äù*** philosophy and the voice notes that run throughout his music.

**Case Study**

**Era Mix**

Dedicated to a specific era of dance music such as a genre or encapsulated by a location. Jackmaster‚Äôs focus on 90‚Äôs classics summarised a particular era of Ibiza. [Flight Facilities](https://soundcloud.com/flightfacilities/sets/the-decade-mixes-1) have released a number of ‚ÄúDecade Mixes‚Äù from 1962 through to 2022.

**Scene Mix**

Another from Bullion, this one focussed on a particular scene and exemplifies the more eclectic nature of him as a producer. These offer a deeper dive into obscurity and appeal to the crate-digging DJ and producer end of electronic. All ideas should start with Ones.

### Intimate Listening Sessions

Post COVID there‚Äôs a rise in alternative and more intimate environments for people to experience DJ sets and curated playbacks. The recent [Listening Room at the Lisson Gallery](https://www.lissongallery.com/exhibitions/devon-turnbull-ojas-hifi-listening-room-dream-no-1) proved a successful talking point throughout the summer. Given the nature of ONES‚Äò music we‚Äôd expect him to have an audiophile type of fan which would appreciate these types of playbacks.

### TikTok_Instagram

The suggested content for TikTok and Instagram feel aesthetically matched to the mysticism around ONES and his brand of electronic music production, not to mention thematically with the new music. A few thoughts based on his suggested forever TikTok ideas:

**TikTok**

At the risk of oversimplifying, being an individual presence on TikTok can fall into one of two camps; those who face and talk to camera and those that don‚Äôt. Adopting a more aesthetically driven approach to content can have limitations versus the direct to camera approach of an individual. However, TikTok does have a wide reaching audience and research into more accounts within this aesthetic could yield partnership opportunities for music placement.

**Instagram**

Unlike Tiktok, Instagram is perceived to be more moodboard friendly and the type of content outlined in ONES deck such as the [/unknownexits_](https://www.instagram.com/unknownexits_/) account should resonate well here. Likewise we should conduct research into more accounts within this genre where we could partner with on music placement.

*‚ÄúThe music raises the dark corners and questions in **ùëúùëõùëíùë†** mind and the imagery makes us question what is real and what we want to believe in. ‚Äú*

### Vinyl

Whether focussing on the previously released or the new music, establishing a vinyl buying audience for ONES should be of focus. These should be limited releases with focus on stockists of eclectic electronic music as well as ONES‚Äô D2C. Some key stockists include:

### Data Collection

Establishing a methodology for connecting and super-serving fans on a personal level from as early as possible should be of focus.

**Discord**

Electronic and dance music as a genre has arguably adopted Discord quicker and to a greater extent than other genres. It can feel like a leap to start one as you want a thriving and active community from the get go. Are there any Discord communities where ONES is already a participant?

**Mailing List**

Still the most tried and true method for maintaining relationships with fans. While open rates can operate around the 25%-35% mark, an email mailing list remains a lower barrier for new fan participation. Mailchimp still the industry standard and free plans for under 1K monthly sends.

**Phone Number List**

While email mailing lists can have a passivity to them, a mobile phone number solution via SMS can be a more concrete link with fans. The offset is the price given varying carrier charges such as [Laylo](http://laylo.com). We‚Äôre also currently exploring a Whatsapp solution with [co:brand](https://music.cobrand.com/) and hopefully can launch soon. This more intimate connection feels appropriate with ONES music and the connection of simplistic and direct messages.

**Bandcamp**

Aside from a strong community for releasing independent music, Bandcamp has a good range of features for communicating direct with fans including being able to segment based on location and revenue.

**PAYG Phone Number**

Forgoing some of the more standardised industry solutions you could default to a burner phone and PAYG number. It‚Äôs heavier lifting in terms of managing contacts and messaging but can be more cost effective in the short term and simplified method for sending messages.
