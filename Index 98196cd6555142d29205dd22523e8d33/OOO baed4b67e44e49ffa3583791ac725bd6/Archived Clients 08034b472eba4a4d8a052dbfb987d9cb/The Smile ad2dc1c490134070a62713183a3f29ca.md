# The Smile

**Ben call – 01/11**

Doesn’t see where OOO can come in on this record now the band are delivering more from their side and some ideas that have been proposed have already been rejected

Wants us to keep chatting in regards to album #3

Agreed that we should be part of the ongoing dialogue around album #2 into starting album #3 as opposed to a cold start in Spring 2024

Adam to go back and advise that we can explore more that doesn’t involve the artist directly – Rough Trade, co:brand (do they see value in these?)

**Meeting – 20/10**

**Brian** – see more fan to fan connection in the next year

**Julie** – band are always keen on exciting and unconventional ideas

**Julie** – band won’t make themselves that accessible IE, not much if any traditional press

**Brian** – asked how will we work together logistically

**What Is Music? Podcast**

“Weird that it’s two members of Radiohead?”

“the two primary creative forces of Radiohead, want to make music together, why are they not just going to Radiohead and saying “let’s make music together?””

Previous tours of Thom and Jonny (Italy only) has been Thom’s sole material and RH songs 

**Questions**

How many Radiohead fanpages are there? Reddit, Twitter, Podcasts.

Have The Smile ever played a Radiohead song live?

---

### **Core Question**

How does The Smile reach more Radiohead fans?

### **Radiohead-lite?**

Given how closely Radiohead are held in fan’s hearts inevitably the band will cast a long shadow over any member’s individual releases. And by definition, what comes after, especially with a band as established as Radiohead is difficult to overcome **s*ide project*** categorisation, evident in numerous headlines upon announcement of the band and their first single**.** Given the number of individual member releases to date it would be fair to assume that Radiohead fans are accustomed to the band’s members releasing music outside of their core. What ultimately feels different with The Smile and isn’t escaping media and fans is the combination of Thom and Jonny. Perceived to be the two primary creative forces of Radiohead, and whose individual output spans numerous releases and years, teaming up as The Smile feels like it’s even more indebted to Radiohead. When fandom is as passionate and strong as Radiohead inspire this shadow looms large and as is illustrated briefly below, it can end up feeling like a lesser version of Radiohead.

**Unpopular opinion about The Smile [[Reddit]](https://www.reddit.com/r/radiohead/comments/tx8508/unpopular_opinion_about_the_smile/)**

*“I think all these new Smile songs are solid but nothing particularly amazing that stacks up against Radiohead’s best but they are all good.”* 

*“…I just had higher expectations and for the Smile to take a different direction to the current Radiohead sound.”*

**Johnny Greenwood says The Smile "have a big backlog of ideas" [[Reddit]](https://www.reddit.com/r/radiohead/comments/14b354n/johnny_greenwood_says_the_smile_have_a_big/)**

*“This will be unpopular but I’m happy Thom and Jonny are in a place where they are creative and productive. A lot of people only want more music that says “Radiohead” on it.”*

*“as much as I love seeing Radiohead live too, seeing The Smile just hits different, smaller, more intimate venues, they seem more relaxed and to be enjoying it more too, I was lucky enough to see their first ever show in front of an audience and that’s something I will always feel really lucky for.”*

**In balance between the for and against arguments**

*“Agree that their current musical output is a huge blessing to RH fans. The only complaint I think is justified is that the longer they perform/record as The Smile the further away we are from seeing Radiohead material performed live again.”*

This more central perspective illustrates that such is the sacred space Radiohead occupy for fans, the perception is the more The Smile continue to record and play live feels like it’s at the expense of anything new from Radiohead.

From our side this inseparability of The Smile from Radiohead is exacerbated due to a few points:

- The Smile contains 2 Radiohead members, arguably the two most creatively driven members of the band
- The Smile debuted at Glastonbury’s Live at Worthy Farm, a location synonymous with Radiohead
- The album was produced by Nigel Godrich
- The artwork created by Stanley Donwood
- Perhaps a more tenuous comparison but the ‘Live at The Montreuax Jazz Festival’ release could feel familiar to ‘I Might Be Wrong’ given how few bands release live albums any longer
- Sonically rich, fans and media have commented on The Smile’s sound being so closely related to Radiohead

To counterpoint this inseparability and the resulting symptom of being categorised as a side project, our proposed objective and strategy is towards shifting the perception of The Smile to be its own unique offering. To achieve these objectives we propose adopting the following top line marketing approaches:

- Creative Radiohead links are kept implicit rather than explicit; we understand Nigel Godrich isn’t producing the next album but Stanley Donwood is confirmed to create the album artwork
- Addressing the core question of how we reach more Radiohead fans, we establish greater direct links to communicate with fans as opposed to traditional promo approach with media
- We deliver a number of unique activations and points of engagement across the album from pre-announcement through to post-release
- We use advanced targeting services across social media to hyper-focus on audience segmentation when it comes to content distribution and advertising

### Radiohead vs The Smile – Instagram Analysis

A data analysis between the two bands will allow us to establish benchmarks in which to identify growth and fan penetration as we move into album #2 and the implementation of the marketing ideas. While an ongoing data analysis shouldn’t be considered a sole representation of success it will at least provide a quantitative measure of growth and the efforts of reaching new and existing fans.

Instagram doesn't like data-scraping without account authorisation so the below is based on a sample of 20,000 followers (10% of The Smile) and 5,000 likers per post (10-20% of engagement).

**Top Level Metrics:**

- Follower overlap is around 2.28% between the 20k sample. Meaning there was 456 people following both accounts
- Followers of The Smile who like Radiohead's most recent posts, that number went up to 4.8%
- Followers of Radiohead who liked The Smile's most recent posts were all sub 1%

Extrapolating the data out, the estimation is that it’s potentially closer to 5% overlap but could range as high 10%. However, as it stands the data doesn't suggest its as high as 20-25% but we can establish an accurate analysis with account authorisation. 

**Additional Questions:**

- Establish a segment of Radiohead followers by consistent engagement (likes and commenters)
- Of that segment how many of those follow The Smile?
- Of those followers, what % of them are proactively engaging with The Smile?
- Cross reference this data with Instagram accounts for Thom Yorke, Jonny Greenwood,  Ed O’Brien, Philip Selway, Stanley Donwood

### Rough Trade Focus Mailer

**Overview**

Similar to the Rough Trade label focus features where they highlight key artists and releases from the label’s roster, we propose approaching Rough Trade to run a similar feature on Radiohead and the number of previous individual member releases. The highlight focus here would be on The Smile and the new album spearheading the feature. 

**Value**

Rough Trade is undoubtedly a prominent record store for a traditional demographic of Radiohead fans and one that has been supportive of The Smile previously making the debut album their #2 AOTY. Likely a paid for feature with Rough Trade, this discography-type breakdown is a more explicit connection of The Smile to Radiohead but one not led by the band.

**Action**

- Reach out to Rough Trade to establish possibility of securing this type of feature based around an artist along with fee
- Coincide run date with album announcement and pre-order of the new album
- Possible Rough Trade exclusive version of the album to enhance the feature
- Establish any specific targeting of prior The Smile and Radiohead customers with an exclusive incentive

### Stanley Donwood x Thom Yorke x Fans – The Smile Artwork Collaboration

**Overview**

With Stanley Donwood confirmed to produce the artwork for the new album and the recently announced The Crow Flies Part One gallery exhibition, we propose a collaborative idea inviting fans to submit artwork in the spirit of a particular inspired theme around the new album. The submissions could be reviewed by Stanley and Thom, highlighting their favourite selections and could form the basis of merch, live posters, a limited printed booklet with profits donated to charity. In addition, or the standalone outcome, it could simply be a website exhibiting the submissions tying back to the forthcoming album.

**Value**

The undeniably rich and longterm visual partnership between Stanley and Thom means the ability for other visual artists to envision themselves working with the band will likely feel inaccessible. This invitation creatives **inclusive collaboration** **that allows fans to feel like they have had a direct creative input into the band’s new album**. The selections from Stanley and Thom **validates the artists and their work** from two people they undoubtedly have a lot of respect for.

**Action**

- Identify creative brief; themes of album to inspire the artwork
- Establish the usage of the submissions; website showcase, merch, live / tour posters, limited 12” release
- Setup a website where fans can submit their artwork

### The Smile Live

**Overview**

Unquestionably with the announcement of The Smile shows and touring was the hope that with two members of Radiohead, there was a high hope the band would play a Radiohead song(s) in their set. You only have to quickly scan Reddit and Twitter to observe fans postulating as to this to be an almost certainty. It’s commendable that the band have stayed firm in focusing purely on The Smile’s original material when there’s an obvious benefit in triggering a Radiohead fanbase. Playing even one select Radiohead song would stir the most staunch Radiohead fans into action towards The Smile let alone the media jumping on the news following the performance. 

**Interpolation**

While playing a Radiohead song live might be considered too explicit in the desire to reach fans an alternative could be a brief interpolation of a beloved Radiohead song into a the live show. This could be in the form or a medley between Smile songs or positioned as The Smile reworking or remix. This will no doubt spark conversation among Radiohead fans and groups, even more so if it could be different songs at different shows.

**Venues**

The stunningly remarkable live shows The Smile have played are clearly a well received part of their proposition by fans and media. The return to live music following numerous lockdowns along with rising rents due to a cost of living crises has resulted in many grassroots music venues fighting to stay open. We could explore a run of shows pre-album release, playing new songs and focusing on a select number of UK shows in towns and cities which rarely benefit from larger touring musicians. The tickets can be balloted (good for data collection), priced at an accessible cover reflective of the smaller venues and tied into a PR angle around the importance of small venues towards the health of the industry and musicians in the UK.

**24 Hour Live Stream**

The From The Basement, Live From Worthy Farm and Magazine webcasts have felt like key moments for Radiohead and The Smile. We propose a similar unique live stream, pre-recorded and run on a seamless loop or perhaps scheduled to broadcast at periodic times throughout a 24 hour period (similar to the 3x Magazine shows). Location should be a considered place integral to the band or the cause of a key talking point. One proposed idea would be to try and secure access to **Brixton Academy**; such is the beloved venue and current delay in its reopening this would undoubtedly be significantly newsworthy among fans and media. 

**UNDERPLAY LIVE SHOWS**

As discussed in our meeting, the intention to play a number of limited underplay shows where fans have to turn up at the venues in which purchase tickets will give us a lot to work with. This is no doubt  strong anti-tout newsworthy story. We would expect the turnout to be far more than the venue’s capacity so an immediate captive audience in which to engage with fans. As proposed, we could setup a Local Area Network (LAN) where a webpage and content is only accessible once fans access this LAN. This could be an unheard song, video, exclusive merch or more. This would also help counter the fact some fans will be disappointed having not been able to secure tickets.

This could loop with doubles of each member being included playing multiple instrument to creat ans feeling of disorientation and catch people off guard.

### Teasing

**Overview**

The strength of Radiohead and The Smile’s fandom means any cryptic teasing and breadcrumbs of information are seized upon. Already there are fans who feel they have determined the name of album #2 to be [**Wall of Eyes](https://www.reddit.com/r/radiohead/comments/15f82zu/the_smile_lp2_title_seemingly_revealed/).** Hidden clues in forum message boards, tweets, torrents, Discord bots, AI applications, Whatsapp messages, deepfakes, HTML code and EXIF data can create a web of information that engages fans to converse and work together to unearth secrets and clues towards new music, content and more. We’d propose designing an elaborate teaser campaign in conjunction with the band and label in disseminating information around the forthcoming album, music, videos, shows and more.

**Radiohead Fan Network**

From the [r/Radiohead](https://reddit.com/r/radiohead) and [r/TheSmile](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSmile/) subreddits, [citzeninsane.eu](http://citzeninsane.eu), [ateaseweb.com](http://ateaseweb.com), [greenplastic.info](http://greenplastic.info) through to the Radiohead Public Library and W.A.S.T.E. HQ the online presence and network of Radiohead fans is a captive audience that should be mobilised to discovering new music and more from The Smile. The strength of these fan’s proactivity will act as an advocate for The Smile towards outlying Radiohead fans in focusing towards discovery of The Smile.

**The Crow Flies Exhibition (originally written prior to exhibition taking place)**

With this taking place in September it could act as a prime opportunity to tease information from the new album. 

- Engage fans via a direct exclusive invite to the exhibit
- Tease music played within the gallery
- Messages hidden within any descriptions of the pieces or programme guide

**Vinyl & Merch**

Surprise releases of limited vinyl and merchandise can act as a powerful precursor to wider announcements. 

- Hidden messages in the runout grooves of vinyl, either as an engraving or a locked groove where the audio plays backwards
- Vinyl distributed to record stores globally without any prior announcement leading to serendipitous self-discovery
- Message or announcement printed within the washing instructions label
