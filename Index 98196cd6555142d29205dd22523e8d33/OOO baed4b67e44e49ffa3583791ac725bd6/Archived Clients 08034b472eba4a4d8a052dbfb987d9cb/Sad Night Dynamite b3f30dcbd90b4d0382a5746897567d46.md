Speak with Rob

a lot of fashion press

Demand from festivals

BBC playlist

AWAL funding but they want more explanation on what we’re doing

Design the release strategy

Zee Zimmer 

wants to be a the forefront of creative

SND Corp

Need to be more accessible 

AWAL are great but George knowing how he wants to do it

SND can get in their own way on music but not marketing

6 month plan of exciting shit

anti-hero stance – we’re not the artist with the problem but we can see what the problem is

Tone and copy of posts

Not being too meticulous and high barrier to entry

Part creative, part commissioner

lots of SND easter eggs – white label, visualise in france, white limo in all videos of mixtape

Deck as to what we can do

AWAL aren’t going to design the band’s marketing plan and strategy

Slide insta / grotesk group

The farcical, the absurd - Brooklyn Beckhams photo book 

How did this not get stopped? 

Tyler – post album deluxe, ident “call me if you lost”

BTS – big collation of all BTS content

Misspelled / illegible comments on Insta to make it look like a glitch 

The video / picture comment which people still don’t know what it means 

Computer game remixes - bo en 

Artists: Gorillaz, Paris Texas, KLF

John Higgs for bio

Situationist theory

Adam Curtis references

What’s your ideology

What do you want fans to believe and say

We’re not trying to reach the masses but rather subcultural communities

When we determine a few of the core factors this forms the basis of marketing ideas and activations

Meeting - 09/11

- Absurdity
- Buy a limo - shoot content, merch (keyrings)
- Comments in russian
- The album doesn’t have a narrative but SAD is the common denominator- bring it back to them
- Invite fan to dress up and go on the mosh pit for shows
- Explore John Higgs for bio
- TikTok - sugababy actors, influencers for these accounts to use song
- Twitter scripts / bots to fight each other
- Deepfakes of their voices swapped
- Die Antwood reference of a mouse in interviews
- Not dystopian futurism (Adam)
- Not apathy for the sake of it. Not everything needs an explanation or end point
- Keep people guessing that there doesn’t need to be an answer but that there is one, it’s just not always important
- Every now and then communicate a serious point - still stand for something
