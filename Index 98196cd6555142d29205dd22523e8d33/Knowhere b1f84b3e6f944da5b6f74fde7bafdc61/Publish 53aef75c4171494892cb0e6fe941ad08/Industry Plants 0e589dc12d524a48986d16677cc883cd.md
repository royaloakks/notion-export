# Industry Plants

Imagine the scene: you’re releasing a new song. Perhaps it’s your debut single, and for all those people you have sent it to; streaming, press, radio, maybe some social influencers, they have all turned around and told you they were going to go big with their support of the track. Would you ask them not to? After all, if you’re going out of your way to engage with any of these areas you’re wanting them to expose the song to a wider audience through whatever means they have available. Right?

Can you imagine yourself turning around and saying *“thanks, but maybe instead of going BIG big, can you perhaps dial it back by about 50%”*? Given the 120K songs being released to streaming services every day surely we should be taking what we can get, when we can get it? Such is the ridiculousness of release volume we’re having to work against we’re not going to begrudge people wanting to support our music. Because of this ridiculousness of release volume we have to be competitive, we need more than half an eye on other artists and the areas they’re gaining traction in. We’d do well to spend more time comparing our performance to ourselves but we shouldn’t be oblivious to the fact we’re competing for attention in limited blogs space, playlist track limit and radio length. If you’re being supported then there’s an ever growing list of artists which aren’t and vice versa. 

This competitiveness creates sensitivity and when we see support for artists seemingly bestowed upon them out of nowhere, or perhaps a chain of successive opportunities all finely falling into place as if it’s all predestined, eyebrows are raised, defences go up and arguments abound. This is in large part where we find claims of the industry plant flying around. As if there’s some conspiratorial work at play, an illuminati meeting of industry and media players divinely pledging to elevate a chosen one. The music industry is rarely harmonious enough to get anyone to agree on anything half the time but what are we really saying when we make claims of an artist being a plant?

The above playlists don’t include third party playlists, major label playlist brand ‘Digster’ and ‘HITS’, user playlists, and Spotify’s Discover Weekly and other algorithmically generated playlists.

Out of all the primary promotional areas, streaming is the one which comes under the most scrutiny when it comes down to how they support artists. Arguably this is due to the more transactional nature of their relationship with artists and labels, as if money being involved means they lack editorial independency. Support of the single wasn’t isolated to streaming though, take a look at the press and radio support.

It doesn’t take too much of an objective eye to conclude that the above is a very impressive degree of support for an artist’s debut single. I’ll expand further on the Last Dinner Party to address the litany of chatter around what they apparently do and don’t deserve but for now we’re continue to explore this through an industry lens. 

Let’s take a snapshot of other artist’s releasing singles within a few weeks surrounding The Last Dinner Party’s ‘Nothing Matters’. This isn’t an exhaustive list (120K releases a day, remember?) and in the interests of keeping this somewhat concise i’ll work with the following filters:

- Included on Spotify UK’s New Music Friday, 3 weeks either side (unlikely to achieve same type of support due to competition)
- Artist has released between 1 - 5 tracks, first single released no earlier than September 2022
- Artist is from the UK, Ireland, US or Australia
- Avoided collaborations
