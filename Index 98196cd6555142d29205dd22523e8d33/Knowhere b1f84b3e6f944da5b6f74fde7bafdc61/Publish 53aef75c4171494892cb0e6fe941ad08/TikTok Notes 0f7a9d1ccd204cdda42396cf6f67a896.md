# TikTok Notes

Technology drives change and music is typically one of the first art forms to be swept up. Such is music’s cultural importance there’s rarely an app with any sort of social element that doesn’t incorporate music in which to solidify its connection between users. If there’s one thing we learned with the fall out of Napster and other P2P networks it’s that the music industry could no longer afford to swim against the tide. We needed to embrace what was coming head-on and we’ve mostly succeeded by evidence of turning around music’s global value being on the up-turn.

When we speak about Napster and the downturn of music’s value those twenty-something years ago we tend to centre the narrative heavily on dollars and cents and less upon the erosion of music’s cultural and social importance. The industry’s endeavour to slow progress and return the consumption model back to a state of (their) control meant music became less culturally important. The advances of internet speeds, the smart phone and Myspace as the first real social media network meant technology quickly became a much more dominant cultural fixation of millennials. Then what happened, we let one through the door and Apple launched iTunes and we could begin the long walk back to financial prosperity. With the birth of the iPhone only a few years later music was the first media to be an embedded selling point. And while we were happy to acknowledge that the waters weren’t as choppy as we expected, we weren’t so quick to let everyone dive in and do what they wanted.

[condense paragraph, don’t need a history lesson but need to illustrate the route from embracing of technology and our lack of understanding how it worked]

Myspace arguably pioneered everything we know today when it comes to social networks and music. The ability to work through from one profile to the next, discovering new music by way of an artist’s ‘top friends’, indie labels with their own pages, again ordering their top friends with their current and flagship artists. Did we fully realise and unlock the potential of what Myspace was at the time? Certainly a number of artists were discovered on the platform and where there’s new music to be discovered there’s an A&R scout waiting to slide into your DMs. If you worked in marketing then you likely had half an eye on Myspace but the labels didn’t have a dedicated “New Media” individual let alone a team. Why would you? one lonely social network to contend with? a now dream for many social media manager. 

The move from Myspace to Facebook, then to Instagram, on to Snapchat, with a slight deviation into Triller and then arriving at TikTok tells us a few things; most notably that evolution will dethrone almost anyone but simply, people like to connect and music facilitates and soundtracks that connection. [talk about discovery]. At its peak in 2008 MySpace had XXX users, TikTok now has XXX global users and time spent on the App outweighs time registered MySpace by XXX. 

What started with Napster was an acceleration of new consumption avenues for music and while Napster was successfully killed off those that came after (mostly) endeavoured to learn the lessons of a jilted music industry. If you wanted to play then you had to negotiate on terms that would remunerate the industry and contribute to the long-term rebuild. As this took place and a succession of new platforms emerged they didn’t all do so at the cost of the previous one. Facebook surpassed MySpace in 2008 as the most popular social network but it didn’t kill MySpace overnight. Likewise when Facebook bought Instagram the latter, while eventually experiencing a decline in younger users in favour of parents insisting we accepted their friend request, it added another avenue into the mix in which to promote music. Add in the number of streaming services and opportunity for growth as well as Snapchat and TikTok t all varying degrees of advantage over one another and there’s a board scope for artists and their labels in which to cover. 

So now there’s a problem, there’s a LOT more work than there ever was and a lot of that rules of engagement on these platforms aren’t as straight forward as we’ve been accustomed to. While iTunes unbundled the album and illustrated that many fans only wanted to buy only select songs, streaming showed how much they ACTUALLY listened. We moved into a more democratic free market economy where the user really did have the power and we could see first hand just how much they were listening.

It didn’t take us long to identify that in order to reach streaming fans we’d need to feature on flagship playlists such as the quickly coveted New Music Friday on Spotify. Even then you bang to realise the difficulty in standing out on those playlists, behaviour observed that the lower down on the playlist you featured the lower the streams. While the playlists owned by Spotify delivered impressive numbers, there were alternatives in playlists owned by pre-existing media such as Pitchfork and the NME, record labels themselves showcasing new releases but that of other artists they wanted to celebrate in acknowledgment of cultural alignment. There were dedicated independent playlist brands that emerged and grew some impressive number of followers to their suite of playlists, some of which rivalled Spotify owned playlists. 

The honeymoon didn’t last for long and around XXX YEAR Spotify began saving the platform’s all important real estate for their own playlists, demoting those created by *users* and therefore limiting their impact and ability to compete. This also coincided with the one social element that existed in Spotify, the ability to message other users and friends directly within the service. With this tweak it meant that being able to identify and connect with the curators of these third party playlists were the preserve of those who had built up a contact list prior or some investigative skills in which to track down Instagram profiles by way of Spotify usernames in which to effectively pitch a song for inclusion.

TikTok by no means invented the influencer, YouTube had a long storied history of creating self-made celebrities with impressively high subscriber numbers; a cross section of Mincecraft gamers, reactionary videos, makeup tutorials and unboxing of Nike drops. The ability to command healthy fees though brand deals were an important additional income to the ad-revenue generated through the content itself. Instagram was an image first platform with video surpassing static content as a number of daily posts in XXX YEAR. It made becoming and influencer far lighter lifting, simply point your phone, record in-app, edit, apply filters as necessary (almost always necessary) and upload. It was much more nimble and reactive than the longer-form and what many perceived as HD content produced for YouTube channels. 

We focussed on views and likes to measure engagement, comments were important but we can take it or leave it. But the true measure was the native TikTok element of creations – with XXX videos created on the platform every day and music being able to be used as a report, a duet from another video, the ability for a song to spread from one user to the next, exacerbated by that superior algorithm’s for you page, the power of TikTok really came into perspective. The cases are many and i don’t need to break them down but to note [insert chart stat of # of songs in chart thanks to TT].

When you’re laying waste to your competitors with your superior tech then you’re going to keep it a closely guarded secret like it’s the Colonel and his herbs and spices.  

Lets not hire ex-streaming employees, hire developers who know algorithms. How can you reverse engineer it?

TikTok made becoming an influencer so much lighter lifting than YouTube. IG and Twitter didn’t facilitate creators in the way TikTok leaned in.
