# Industry Plant notes

- Industry plant
    - Last Dinner Party
        - Similarity between headlines, quotes and “mess of stages” cribbed from the press release (lazy journalism)
    - Shortlist artists in the last few years who have had the same said of them in the NME
    - It’s not the bands fault
    - There’s a long way to go
    - Question of authenticity
    - Media likes to back a sure thing
    - Assume all of the initial conversations were on a silo… the stars aligned.
    - We’re so keen to get behind something
    - Let them fail, they’re developing in plain sight and we’re making the rod for their back
    - Of course you wouldn’t begrudge it, it’s damn fun for the doors to open so quickly
    - But it breeds resentment… and that’s not just misplaced jealousy
    - What do the LDP numbers suggest - 100k ML’s and 300K streams on average is a solid engagement rate
    - The supporters better be prepared to keep turning out. Will the second, third, fourth releases live up to the first? Unlikely the’ll perform as well but we know the performance line doesn’t go upwards, it’s a heart monitor.
    - Backlash has a tendency to follow hype like a shadow, and that hype opens doors very quickly. It creates a momentum that the music industry more often than not rushes to capitalise upon, cries of “make hay while the sun shines” ringing out in meeting rooms from London to LA.
    - Conspiracy theorist approach but what are people’s claim’s founded in?
    - Support on label owned playlists would help and pings the algorithm but why wouldn’t you support on your own label ecosystem?
    - If we were orchestrating a plant with a view to, i don’t know, making festival lineups more equal and promoting future headliners then what better way than elevating an all female band?
    - Ones To Watch and BBC Soundpoll had an influence but in the age of a far more democratically open market place, does the power still rest in them?
    - do you have the industry backing of heavyweights? Managers and labels which act as a filter as to why people would align? Lola Young being managed by Nick and Nick, Adele and Amy former A&Rs and managers.
    - Over value the shorter vs longterm
    - So bloody hard to get started you’d welcome it
    - Backlash from hype
    - Resentment
    - Living up to Hype
    - A product of privilege
    - Apple: Spatial Audio support is the preserve of an artist backed by money seeing as it can average nearly £1K per track

### [Compounding head starts](https://p.feedblitz.com/r3.asp?l=208964135&f=1081591&c=12036662&u=123476380)

When a six-year-old kid beats the other kids at tennis, that kid is more likely to be encouraged to play more, or to get a coach, and pretty soon, they’re much better at tennis than the others.

When a musical group has a single that gets some buzz on Spotify, they’re more likely to be able to find a producer or even a label.

When a candidate polls well early in a race, they’re more likely to get donations, attract consultants, run ads and not be encouraged to drop out…

There are clearly scarcity-based competitions in our culture that reward early success. Acknowledging this (however unfair or suboptimal it is as a sorting mechanism) leads us to two very different sets of tactics:

**One alternative is to dramatically overinvest and overprepare for your debut. If early head starts are rewarded, be sure you have one. This can even involve entering school a year later, or running for dog catcher instead of the senate.**

The other is to acknowledge that even though head starts are sort of random and often reward the wrong folks, you’re going to ignore them. Make sure you have the resources and resolve to develop your following and your skills regardless of how well you do in the first interactions. Day by day and drip by drip.

Most people try to do both, and doing both almost guarantees you’ll burn out.
