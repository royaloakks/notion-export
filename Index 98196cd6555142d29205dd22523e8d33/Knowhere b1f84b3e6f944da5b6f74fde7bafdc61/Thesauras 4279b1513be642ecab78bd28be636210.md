The “Christopher Nolan **doesn’t** use outlines” presents a binary.

The reader thinks ‘okay, then what does he use?

Once you get the reader to ask themselves a question, you’ve got them. They’re interested, and they’re going to pay attention to what you say next

I immediately close that loop and offer a breakdown of the plot map. Hook, line, and sinker. A mini-story in a tweet, and a tactic you can use with any medium.

*“The protagonist’s quest to restore life’s balance by struggling against negative forces is at the heart of all compelling narratives. Therefore, fine storytellers do not avoid the negative side of life; they seek it out.”* -Robert McKee

Backstory can wait, intrigue cannot. Start with action.

Who is the protagonist and the antagonist?

What questions are you trying to answer?

What cliffhangers can you create?

Fragmentary sketches 

Emotional vocabulary 

It’s like hearing a nearby fireworks display – you know someone, somewhere, is probably having a better time than you, but all you’ve got is a headache and an unhappy dog. -Damien Morris

It’s not shock value for the sake of it, it’s drama with purpose.

Bourdain’s description of eating an oyster for the first time. I can’t recall my first oyster but likewise can viscerally recall songs I’ve heard for the first time and the multiple “where were you when” moments.

By any standards of morality it’s objectively awful but…

feeding on the expiring dreams of a succession of misguided souls - a hungry ghost, yearning for money, and drugs.

### Stephen King

Write with the door closed and edit with the door open. Write like it’s for you, edit like it’s for the reader.

Write fast and edit slow.

Write literally with the door closed

Write what you know - that’s what makes you unique

Description begins in the writer’s imagination, but ends in the reader’s.

The key to good description begins with clear seeing and ends with clear writing, the kind of writing that employs fresh images and simple vocabulary.

2nd Draft = 1st Draft - 10%

Words create sentences; sentences create paragraphs; sometimes paragraphs quicken and begin to breathe.

### Rhythm & Flow: Pacing

But a one-liner doesn’t pull you in. It doesn’t trap you and transport you into another world, or let you into another person’s mind. Longer sentences and paragraphs, though tougher to pull off, give you a punch as a writer the short stuff never could.

The real magic, however, comes from contrast.

Short and punchy to deliver the message. Long and winding to suck the reader in, provide detail, and build tension. Short and punchy to keep the reader moving. Long and winding to get them to spend a little more time, to go that extra bit deeper.

- Are there multiple sentences in a row of the same length? If so, how can I shorten or lengthen one?
- Can I combine two sentences, ideally using ['But' or 'Therefore'](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/Od9SVC-Qxin6O8-fpSu19No37SnQX0S7R15fxKWEviFKC7gL99RBruROcTvyeoamRML4gGN5-nTE_ddoyQGHpVrq0ZO0ENUGsi87w6XTaAMiHIJIO-IYvEjHYQbCsfP648yvc9bryqzJra43SzuZRdHaq9gHevcUuxFWy99l9Babq3PLICsjjshWtBFmSIysS4G4s3ZiMj6rnaOtzu6S3UvbQXH9CmXxBE6wy5sdMd-wSvO97kKIpa--EeRfnlKQ6Ghk6FkHUOTXl9FPxwG3-odPflLyW4ivlMoCQ_A-71oKkSohwLuZCh5J23nVlQ5gZF-Oaa885CN1ga-Llab_IB1vX6SFv5SQXNVLsP8n_JzEILae5PXhYduUAPmXO_-kmBnCXGzznIo3kGFEp9FLIjVdOoWnKw7zhBDc3RBhSllAILObUoBtHdtHFJrihSj1r6pqP0qJbUdP77Ozhk4KdKN-HPk9tkbr-AL5cFdkPSWYZIrrEKuHG1J1i-e1hhQ3/3vr/DoLwsAiuRBmhj2tDx86tBg/h12/elQuBgNanY0_B_MDeqkP0e6Dum--YgsdcdIN7NUFUoA) instead of 'And?'

### **The Day You Became A Better Writer**

I went from being a bad writer to a good writer after taking a one-day course in “business writing.” I couldn’t believe how simple it was. I’ll tell you the main tricks here so you don’t have to waste a day in class.

Business writing is about clarity and persuasion. The main technique is keeping things simple. Simple writing is persuasive. A good argument in five sentences will sway more people than a brilliant argument in a hundred sentences. Don’t fight it.

Simple means getting rid of extra words. Don’t write, “He was very happy” when you can write “He was happy.” You think the word “very” adds something. It doesn’t. Prune your sentences.

Humor writing is a lot like business writing. It needs to be simple. The main difference is in the choice of words. For humor, don’t say “drink” when you can say “swill.”

Your first sentence needs to grab the reader. Go back and read my first sentence to this post. I rewrote it a dozen times. It makes you curious. That’s the key.

Write short sentences. Avoid putting multiple thoughts in one sentence. Readers aren’t as smart as you’d think.

Learn how brains organize ideas. Readers comprehend “the boy hit the ball” quicker than “the ball was hit by the boy.” Both sentences mean the same, but it’s easier to imagine the object (the boy) before the action (the hitting). All brains work that way. (Notice I didn’t say, “That is the way all brains work”?)

That’s it. You just learned 80% of the rules of good writing. You’re welcome.
