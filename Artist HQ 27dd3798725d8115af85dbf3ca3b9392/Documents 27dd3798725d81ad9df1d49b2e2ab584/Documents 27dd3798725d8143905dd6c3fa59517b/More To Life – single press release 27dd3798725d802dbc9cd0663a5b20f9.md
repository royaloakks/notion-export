A beam of light: More to Life, Moses Boyd, artist, composer, father, carrying rhythm, carrying us. Shantéh holds the flame, the song opening like a confession you don’t mean to say out loud, something overheard, first for herself, then spilling into the room, where we catch it. It doesn’t move like a single announcing itself; it breathes, it wrestles, it admits. Boyd lays a ground less like a beat than a pulse, steady, insistent, reminding you you’re still here. 

Over it, Shantéh sings — first inward, then outward - her voice circling us. It carries the rawness of a late-night prayer, whispered until it becomes song. Less performance than revelation, less revelation than need. Words and organ heavy with the knowledge of someone who has lived inside the weight long enough to name it: there’s more to life than this. Not a slogan, not a chant, but a crack in the line, doubt pressing against hope, hope pressing back. 

And somewhere in it, you hear that same reaching Lauryn Hill once named — that peace of mind she searched for, tearing herself open to find a center, a stillness, even in the noise. Boyd and Shantéh searching too, wrestling sound into testimony, layering until the track becomes less song than release, pressure breaking, hurt and healing at once.

Testimony, not polish. Struggle named, survival sounded. In their reaching just beyond despair, they join that ongoing search — not arrival, but a making of breath, a making of space where we might stay, together, still.
