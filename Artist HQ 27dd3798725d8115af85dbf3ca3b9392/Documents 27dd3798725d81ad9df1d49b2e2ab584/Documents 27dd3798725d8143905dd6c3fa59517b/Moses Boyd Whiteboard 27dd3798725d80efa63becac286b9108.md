## Initial Document Review Questions

**PUSH EVERYTHING BACK!** 

### January Album Release

- Objectives:
    - Chart?
    - Position for as much critical support as possible
- Notable 2026 Album Releases
    - Jan 9th: Dry Cleaning, The Cribs, Zach Bryan
    - Jan 16th: Cavetown, DZ Deathrays
    - Jan 23rd: PVA
    - Jan 30th: Yumi Zouma
    - There’s a Lana Del Rey TBC release in January apparently

### Objectives

- Sell out UK / EU tour – focus ok KOKO

### Questions

- What’s the warm-up engagement?
    - Tour announce is next week
- Where do the church shows fit into the timeline?
    - How many can you do?
    - Coincide with single launch parties
        - Pre-order album for access? Necessary if not chart objective
        - Ensure access is equal so people can’t attend to more than one
- Listening event (business card invites – where does this fit in the timeline)?
- How many ideas from the deck can we execute in budget?
- Is the album talk exactly what it says? Why so early?
- Potential to push tour announce back a week? What does promoter / agent feel on tour announcement cold?
- Album announcement on single #2?
- Merch batches?
- In-stores
- Pop-ups
- Album discussions

### Strategy

- Max engagement prior to tour announcement and single #1 release
- Tease narratives of where is Moses? Dropped an important UK album, mercury nominated and now where is he?
- Surprise update of website with signup
    - Classic: where do you want me to come play?
- 

### Observations

- Low engagement
- Low streaming
- Announcing a tour cold
-
