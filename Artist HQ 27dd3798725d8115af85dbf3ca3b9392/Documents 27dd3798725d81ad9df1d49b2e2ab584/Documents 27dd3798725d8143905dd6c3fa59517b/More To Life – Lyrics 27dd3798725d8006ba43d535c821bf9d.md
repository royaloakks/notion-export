**Verse 1**
Look up and realise
Answer the questions
They’ve been on your mind
Don't let life slip away
Hoping waiting for a change
Maybe you're by yourself?
Weight of the world is heavy on your health
Still tryna figure out
But deep inside you know, you know

**Chorus**
There's more to life than this
There's more to life than this

**Verse 2**
Burnt, broken, bitter, lies
Never compassion, only criticized
And all the time you spend
Wondering when you'll smile again
Longing for peace of mind, maybe already searching for a sign
Still tryna figure out
But deep inside you know, you know

**Chorus**
There's more to life than this
There's more to life than this
