# OOO

## Stormzy

- EP with Ghetts:
    - Where can you pop up impulsively and unexpectedly?
    - Low-key high value and credit visibility:
        - Benji B interview to launch (Benji a big Ghetts fan)
        - Benji pro-Palestine so could help soften the narrative around Stormzy and the deleting posts prior to McDonalds collab
- Problems:
    - What does Stormzy perceive to the be the obstacles to overcome?
    - Any narratives that he wants to correct?
    - What narratives to lead with?
- Objectives:
    - For the Ghetts EP
    - For the new music in 2026
