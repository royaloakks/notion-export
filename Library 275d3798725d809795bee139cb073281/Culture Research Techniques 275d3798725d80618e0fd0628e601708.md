**RUMBLE CREATIVE BRIEF**

- **What is the objective of the piece?**
What does the communication aim to achieve? Are there hard objectives? Like generating leads? Or driving sales? Is there a specific benchmark that needs to be achieved? Like achieving a 20% response rate? Or are the objectives softer? Announcing a new product for instance? Whatever the objective, make it concrete and specific. Who are you talking to?
Paint a picture of the target audience. Their needs, desires and wants. As well as the things they don't like, don't care for or don't want.

- **What do they currently think about your product or service?**
Do they like it? Trust it? Prefer it over other, similar offerings? Or do they currently have issues with the product? Barriers that stop them from buying it?

- **What do you want them to think?**
What mind shift do you want to create? What transformation? What words would you like to hear from the customer's mouth after they have read our communication?

- What features and benefits do we want the audience to hear about?
What specifics about our product or service will create interest, create resonance and create desire?

- **What do you want our audience to do?**
Is a response required from the communication? Do you want people to order from you? Or do you want to drive them to a physical location? An online store perhaps? Do you want them to download a voucher? Or are you simply writing to them to say thank you for their support?
Perhaps you want to convey a brand message?

- **What's the single most important promise you are making?**
There may be many messages you want to get across in your communication. But you need to choose the most important one. The one that is going to solicit the most impactful response. Please avoid using 'and' in your promise. The use of the word means there are two separate thoughts in your promise.

- **Why should they believe this?**
Your promise should be supported by facts, benefits and features. Work out what they are and list them in order of importance.

- **What mandatories need to be included in the communication?**
What are the messages, images, logos, assets and legal disclaimers that need to be included?
