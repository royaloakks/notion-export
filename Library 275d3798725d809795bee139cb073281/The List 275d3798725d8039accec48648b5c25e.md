# 💡The List

Simon Sinek’s Why

**The Primary**

1. Who is it for?
2. What is it for?
3. Why is that important?

What is your song about? Love and heartbreak? How are you going to tell me that story in a way I’ve never heard before? In a way I didn’t know I needed to hear it? What’s your use of metaphor that paints the picture we’ve seen a thousand times?

**The Extra 20%**

What’s the extra on top? What’s the 20% and then 10%.

20% is the extra that only the most dedicated fans get. The day ones.

10% is the standard we should always apply that is going to be the thing people talk about.

# 💡 Fan-Centric Artist Branding

Customer-Based Brand Equity (Keller, 1993)

- **Level 1: Make the artist stand out.** The first step is to create brand awareness. People should be able to recognise and identify the artist. This step is harder than it may seem: Most brands never move further from this step.
- **Level 2: Build the artist’s image.** Next, artists should know and communicate what they mean to fans and what the artist’s brand stands for. The [brand’s benefits](https://thefanbasebuilder.substack.com/p/how-an-artist-brand-benefits-fans) come to mind here.
- **Level 3: Manage the fan’s judgements and feelings.** Then, artists should understand how they make fans feel and how fans judge them. This should be aligned with the artist’s brand positioning and the main associations they focus on in their marketing strategy.
- **Level 4: Build strong emotional connections with fans.** Finally, when fans feel deeply connected with the artist's brand, artists should invest in a community ecosystem where fans could engage in meaningful interactions between the artist and their fans and between fans.

# 💡 The Brand Knowledge Model

**Functional benefits** relate to the brand’s problem-solving or problem-removal capabilities. They represent the intrinsic advantages of consuming the brand. For example:

- *I listen to [artist brand] because it helps me focus.*
- *I listen to music to stimulate me during my workout.*

**Experiential benefits** or emotional benefits relate to what it feels like when using the brand. For example:

- *Listening to [artist brand] makes me feel happy/sad.*
- *When I see [artist brand] on Instagram I feel empowered.*

**Symbolic benefits** relate to the brand’s extrinsic, non-product-related advantages, such as social approval and self-expression. Most artist brand positioning focuses on this. For example:

- *I wear a [artist brand] t-shirt to show that I belong to this fan base.*
- *I post this music on my stories to show I’m always the first with new music.*

Analysing the symbolic benefits of a brand gives information about a fan’s identity and the niche, scene and/or community they surround themselves with.

## 💡 Fanbases Making A Social Impact – PACT Model (Tory Fairies)

1. **Product**: Activate your community to share or donate your **product or service**. For decades, airlines have been leveraging this model by empowering travelers to [donate their frequent flier miles](https://wish.org/airline-miles#:~:text=Support%20Our%20Wishes%20in%20Flight%C2%AE%20Program&text=Every%20mile%20donated%20helps%20wish,a%20life%2Dchanging%20wish%20experience.) to organizations like Make-A-Wish. Retailer Madewell recently launched a program where loyal customers [can drop off pre-worn jeans at a local store to be repurposed into housing insulation](https://www.madewell.com/inspo-do-well-denim-recycling-landing.html), and they reward their customers’ good deeds with a $20 store credit.
2. **Advocacy**: Activate your community’s **collective voice** to draw attention to the issue areas your company impact strategy is championing. Call on them to sign petitions, circulate social media campaigns, and show up for change. Bobbie baby formula, a former [client](https://www.bobbieforchange.org/) of mine, activated their community of parents to [call their representatives to urge them to pass legislation to combat the Black maternal mortality crisis](https://www.instagram.com/p/CpNrjGltPKE/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) and rallied parents to march at the Capitol to demand legislative reform after 2022’s infant formula crisis.
3. **Contributions**: Activating your community to **give funds** is one of the most common ways companies engage, and when done right, can be an effective way to double your organization's impact. Clearly communicate your company’s skin in the game through a match or corporate contribution, and work together toward a time-bound, right-sized goal (whether that’s raising $1k or $10M). You’re likely to hear a classic example of this type of campaign on your daily commute when your local public radio station is doing a fund drive (“If callers help us reach our goal of raising $1,000 in the next hour, a local partner will match your effort, dollar for dollar!”).
4. **Time** & **skills**: Activating your community’s **time** can be as simple as inviting them to roll up their sleeves and volunteer alongside your employees for a service project. To tap further into the skills your community has to offer, ask if they have a unique skill they can offer your nonprofit partners. LinkedIn leverages its technology to make it easy for [community members to indicate their willingness to join nonprofit boards](https://blog.linkedin.com/2012/09/17/board-connect).

**Artist Application**

- **Product** - Activate fans to donate an artist’s work. For example, give fans the opportunity to buy an extra ticket for a show and donate these tickets to fans with a lower income or refugees.
- **Advocacy** - Draw attention to an issue by activating a fanbase’s collective voice to sign petitions and post on social media. For example, artists who [raise awareness of climate change](https://www.musicdeclares.net/).
- **Contributions** - Activate fans to raise money. A well-known example is the BTS army, which is [raising millions](https://www.theringer.com/music/2020/6/11/21287283/bts-army-black-lives-matter-fandom-activism) for movements such as Black Lives Matter.
- **Time and skills** - Ask fans to volunteer for a cause. Take BLOND:ISH for example, who’s [founded a foundation](https://www.byebyeplastic.life/) that - among other activities - cleans beaches in Miami and Tulum of plastic.
