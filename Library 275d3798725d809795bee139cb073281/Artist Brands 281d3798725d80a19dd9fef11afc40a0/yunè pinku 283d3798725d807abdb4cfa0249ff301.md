# yunè pinku

**Questions:**

- Who handles merch? Is there a Shopify?
- Do Platoon have any physical rights to the previous EPs? 2x 12” EP release of Bluff and Babylon IX
- Joy Orbison collab
- US rapper collabs
- Album pencilled for 2024, new song this year
- Play for tips – was there any discussion previously
- Cub night: any more planned, branding?

**To Do:**

- Platform Access: Amazon, Bands In Town
- Bandcamp: setup profile and upload previous EPs (Platoon or self upload?)
-

Ideas: carnival set. Specific type of Dj set Or mix - ASMR or ambient. 

Reimagining of an album (Bullion). 

Roblox Spotify partnership. 

Twitch. Web3 / NFT. 

Curation. 

Record shopping - make a mix from selections. 

Mixes to go live on Apple Music. 

Spotify Radar. Apple danceXL playlist cover.

Apple Music 1 show. Radio 1 Residency. Rinse mix. 

Yunèverse - what would be in it that’s reflective of the more introverted world of making music and experiencing music? 

Artwork is indicative of a metaverse / sci-fi universe - what’s a graphic interpretation of yunè like Peggy Gou? It keeps yunè front and centre, maintains a future element but not overly abstract. 

Artwork from forward thinking AI creatives, using Midjourney for example (Uncanny?). 

Benji B / Deviation. What’s the replacement Red Bull lectures? “extroverted music by an introvert” -The Guardian.

Soundscape output prior to dance, post-war radio samples

Bluff : Music to wind down and wind up, an extension of yourself 

Being performative, putting on a tougher front that girls have to do and something she’s always done

> “It’s hard for people to commit to things now, because you’re constantly aware that there might be a better version. People sometimes get so connected to an online picture of themselves that their real self couldn’t match up to… There are all kinds of things that disconnect you from certain parts of reality”
> 

Likes being on her own, comfortable with the isolation, not having to feel like you’re pleasing everyone on the group 

did developing as an artist throughout the pandemic influence a more introverted take on dance music?

> I actually felt the pandemic really helped me! I was never able to spend so much time figuring out sonically what I was and finally had the chance to, under very bizarre circumstances. I did have a lot of teenage angst going on though, just missing out on my ‘prime time’, though looking back I’m pretty grateful because my life’s definitely improved a lot on the other side of the pandemic.
> 

Tries to keep lyrics ambiguous to keep them open to interpretation 

Wants gigs to be a safe and relaxed place for people to be themselves, to enjoy and discover new music, no clout chasing 

Never been a big partier, always associates club culture with danger. Historically too much about getting dressed up and getting drunk. Prefers the more collective element of going out, wants spaces to collaborate in. 

 

> I always want to stay quite retrospective on music, and I don’t want it to be something that’s always about me specifically. And never getting too in your own ego. So far I’ve done pretty well – ego brushing doesn’t really work for me. I want to keep on that. I just don’t want to become a proper diva

> **Has releasing music under a moniker helped you navigate that transition and separate both of those sides of you?**
> 

> I don’t really see myself as a separate thing to yunè pinku, but it helps you tap into parts [of yourself] that you wouldn’t normally be. I wouldn’t normally be the person on stage, I would naturally be around that rather than in the middle. But if I’m yunè pinku today, I can go out and be that version
> 

Safe spaces, route to and from clubs

> I’ve never been a massive partier, really. But I think that was more because I kind of always associated clubbing and stuff with like, you’re putting yourself in danger
> 

Daytime prod / collab meet ups ahead of shows

> But I do like the fact there’s much more independent collectives putting on events now, and opening space for more creatives to all meet each other and potentially collaborate. It’s definitely developing in a positive direction
