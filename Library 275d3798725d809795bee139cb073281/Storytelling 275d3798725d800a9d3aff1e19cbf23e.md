- **Language:** JRR Tolkien invented 15 languages for his books. Create phrases that become so common for your audience they associate them with you or your brand. It’s like inside jokes – shared lingo that only makes sense in your world.
    - **iMessage = Apple:** Apple owns the ‘i’ in front of its products. No other brand can use that without Apple first coming to mind.
    - **wingardium leviosa** **= Harry Potter**: I went to a wedding where the couple exited through everyone holding sparklers. I heard at least five people say this Latin-derived hodgepodge JK Rowling invented 20 years ago. That’s powerful.

- **Rituals**: Tolkien gave each of the different cultures he created their own customs and rituals. People function in this way. Shared rituals make us feel part of a group.
    - **Crumbl Cookies**: Each week, Crumbl releases a new lineup of six cookies to replace last week’s lineup. This creates a sense of anticipation (Crumbl fans look forward to the drop), a sense of urgency (if you don’t buy that kind of cookie this week, you may never again have the chance), and a sense of togetherness (the launch posts get hundreds of thousands of likes on IG and TikTok).
    
    **The Story**
    
    1. **Call To Adventure**: The Hero — appeal to deeply held beliefs about the human condition, like drive for success and persistence through adversity
    2. **Victory Over Crisis**: The Hero’s struggle to overcome adversity, fighting against their foes, competitors, detractors — the wise sage guides them through. First the Hero resists it (It’s not for me), but finally they heed the call for adventure and they face their fears (foes, competitors, detractors), the hero survives and triumphs.
    3. **Transformation**: The Hero’s story doesn’t end with triumph, they must be transformed long-term. Look to the enduring benefits of The Hero and the emotions they inspire in people.

    The Purpose-Told Story: 8 Stages
    
    1. **The Targets**
        
        Before considering our story, we must understand our:
        
        - Target Audience: who we’re talking to
        - Target Need: what problem they have that we can solve
        - Target Action: What we want them to do
        
        Without defining these three we’re guessing
        
    2. **Subject Matter**
        
        The constraints and subjects that make up our story:
        
        - Core Value: the value our brand couldn’t exist without
        - Protagonist: the hero our audience empathises with
        - Setting: society, time and place
    
    1. **The Inciting Incident**
        
        Launch the story by throwing the protagonists story out of whack
        
        Our goal is two-fold:
        
        - Grab your audience’s attention
        - Propel the protagonist to action
        
        “fine storytellers seek out the negative side of life”
        
    2. **The Object of Desire**
        
        An unfulfilled need the protagonist feels the need to get their life back on track.
        
        That happens to be fulfilled by our product / service
        
        the most compelling objects come with a high price tag, a high price to entry.
        
    3. **First Action**
        
        The tactical choice the protagonist makes to re-balance their life.
        
        This cannot succeed. That’d be too easy.
        
        Introduce antagonists – anything keeping the protagonist from the object of desire
        
    4. **The First Reaction**
        
        The reaction to the First Action should be different or more powerful than expected. 
        
        This gap in expectation vs reality leaves space for the protagonist to gain insight.
        
        Two key aspects:
        
        - Violation of expectations
        - Turning points
    
    1. **Crisis Choice**
        
        The moment of truth – this final action must be more risky than the first.
        
        It’s now or never.
        
        The protagonist will either re-balance their life or remain in chaos.
        
    2. **Climatic Reaction**
        
        The protagonist gets their life back on track.
        
        Neuroscientists find the brain’s response to a good story’s climax is a few seconds of heightened memory.
        
        McKee recommends putting your logo right after the climax to take advantage of this. 
        
    
    Start With The End – the audience, their problem and the desired action.
    
    Then Figure Out The Beginning – the event to trigger the story.
    
    Lastly – build the narrative arc to connect the beginning to end
