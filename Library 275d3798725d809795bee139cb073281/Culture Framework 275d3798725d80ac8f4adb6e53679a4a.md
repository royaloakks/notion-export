Main ideological instruments of society:

Law

Religion

Education 

Family 

Ideology provides a conceptual framework through which we interpret and make sense of our lived, material conditions.

Ideology therefore produces our culture, as well as our consciousness of who and what we are.

There are four basic components to the media industry that packages the messages and the products. 

- The message of the product itself
- The audiences who imbibe the message and consume the products
- The ever changing technology that shapes both the industry and the way the message is communicated
- And the final look of the product

What are the current affairs the culture is talking about?
