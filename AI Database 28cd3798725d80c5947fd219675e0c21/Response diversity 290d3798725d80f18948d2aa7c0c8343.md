> **Generate 5 responses with their corresponding probabilities, sampled from the full distribution**
> 

**Purpose**

When prompted in this way, the model no longer defaults to its safest, most typical output. Instead, it verbalizes its internal distribution over potential completions and samples across a wider spectrum of possibilities. This one-line change leads to substantial gains in output diversity across multiple domains.
