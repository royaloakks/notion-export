Because the concert tours themselves were the main source of revenue, the Grateful Dead ran their concerts in a very different way from other bands. For example, each show had a unique set of songs, and each song was played in a unique way, giving fans a strong incentive to see the show for several nights in a row (or weeks, months, or years), because every night you were treated to a different musical experience. This is the exact opposite approach to that taken by other bands. P4

 Each day, Rue La La features a designer boutique, say Villeroy & Boch or St. John, that opens at 11:00 A.M. Eastern and remains open for 48 hours or until merchandise sells out, with a blinking clock counting down the time. Because merchandise can sell out in a matter of minutes, members often set calendar reminders so that they can be at their computers a few minutes before 11:00 A.M. The company sends out e-mail reminders a few days in advance that let people know which designers will be featured on the site.
Since its inception in April 2008, Rue La La has built a passionate fan base of 1.6 million members using viral methods. To become a member, you must receive an invitation from another member. Once a member extends an invitation, he or she receives a $10 credit when each friend places their first order, with no limit placed on the number of credits one can receive. Credits can then be used against any boutique purchase. P7

CREATE YOUR OWN LANDSCAPE

Products that are highly differentiated can still succeed today, but it's much harder to win if your business model is the same as your com-petitors'.
Your job is to do research about your industry in order to build
a killer business model. You want to break free from the competitive landscape and create a cascade of unique benefits for your customers.
ACTION: Creating a unique business model is very difficult and no free lunch exists on how to do it. Rather than tell you how to create a unique business model in your industry, we thought we would give you some hard questions to ask yourself that will get your juices flowing about how to create one:
What are you three times better at than your competitors? What are you three times worse at than your competitors? If the answer is "noth-ing" to both, you are not unique enough to really break out. And no, you can't be better than your competition in all dimensions-you need to rethink the dimensions.
What new technology is emerging that might enable you to upset your industry's apple cart? Could the Internet be a new distribution channel? Could an iPad application catapult you past the competition? Could you use Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) system (an online arena that connects those who have relatively small tasks with people who can perform them) to dramatically lower costs or deliver new value?
Are there societal changes happening that you might take advantage of in your industry, such as empty nesters moving back into cities, more people working from home, a shift to outsourcing to rural America rather than overseas, or increased interest in low-carbon-footprint lifestyles for companies and families, and so on?
Do you have someone who's really smart from outside your industry whom you can ask to help you with this? The problem with creating a unique business model in an industry you grew up in is that you naturally get bogged down in the same industry assumptions that you're trying to break. P9/10

A name like the Grateful Dead is an asset to an organiza-tion. When you select an uncommon name (and one appropriate to your company image and target market) it's unlikely that consumers will confuse your product with something similar. They will remember you. And in today's world of online communications and of search engines, unique names for your company, products, and services allow you to own the search engine results for your brands. Most companies don't focus enough attention on choosing a memorable name or on the importance of Google, Bing, and other search engines when selecting those names. Typically people closest to the product development effort are the ones proposing the candidate names. This usually leads to overly technical names focused on what a product does (something like "MP3 Deluxe Pocket Player" rather than a memorable name that appeals to customers, like "iPod"). P15

FIND YOUR MEMORABLE NAME

Naming is tough. But it is a very important element of marketing. Most organizations don't spend enough time on this important activity.

ACTION: Here are some things to keep in mind and a few tricks you might try as you think of a name:

- Avoid common names and names that are already used as a title of a popular movie or book. You will want to have a name that shows up as the top listing for search results in the search engines and social media sites.
- Use search engines before finalizing a name. You don't want to fall in love with a name that doesn't yield the top search results.
- Find inspiration in unlikely places. Why not go to one of the online booksellers (such as Amazon.com, BN.com, or Borders.com) and search the name of the category of product you are trying to name.
You'll see a list of book titles and subtitles that may spark an idea.
- Many people choose made-up words as a name. This is great because you can own the search results. But try not to choose one that is too esoteric or difficult to pronounce if you go this route.
- You might take two words that are very different and put them together as one word, like SurveyMonkey, an intriguing company name.
- Try an alternative spelling for a word. "Google" is derived from the word "googol," a number that is 10 to the power of 100 (the numeral one followed by 100 zeros). "Flickr" is "flicker" with the "e" removed.
- In her excellent book POP!, Sam Horn talks about what she calls
"alphabetizing" common words to come up with a name. We like this technique. Take a product you want to name, for example, yogurt in a squeeze tube. Then go through every letter in the alphabet and substitute it for the "y" in yogurt, and presto: "GoGurt" is born.
- Take a common name and change it slightly to create a new word. For example, the name of the social networking site FledgeWing is derived from the word "fledgling." P18/19

RETHINK THE MARKETING DEPARTMENT

Does your marketing team look like everyone else's? Is your marketing organization set up the same way as that of your last company? Is your marketing organization full of "generalist project manager" types aho have heavily overlapping skill-sets? If so, it's time for a change in organization, some new skills development, and new blood (Le., Julia
Poy -style).
ACTION: Organize your marketing team in this way. You want someone responsible for "getting found" (filling the top of your funnel), someone responsible for "converting" the folks who are getting pulled in, and someone responsible for "analyzing" the numbers and helping you make better decisions.
Try to diversify the skill-set in your marketing department and fill in the gaps by hiring or training folks to be digital citizens ("convert team"), who are highly analytical ("analyze team"), have deep market reach ("get found team") and/or are natural-born content creators ("get found team"),
Look outside your marketing department (inside your company) and look outside the marketing industry (outside your company) to fill in talent gaps. P27

SET YOUR EMPLOYEES FREE

So much in the modern marketing world is consistent with what our parents taught us as kids. Our parents taught us to be ourselves, to be honest, to apologize for our mistakes, and to earn people's trust.
ACTION: Encourage employees to contribute to your company blog and to start tweeting about your company. Let them know you trust them to do the right thing-this trust will be rewarded. To help everyone take advantage of your new policy regarding social media, announce a Lunch-and-Learn about blogging best practices, using Twitter effective-ly, proper use of Facebook, and so forth. If you don't have the expertise, go online and search for webinars on the topic and show these at your Lunch-and-Learns.
Speak like a human in your releases, not like a press release robot.
Your marketplace's mother tongue is human-it speaks press release robot as a second language.
If you make a mistake, own up to it-don't try to hide it. P34

Due to the sweeping changes taking place in the Internet and social media, CEOs and small business owners alike tend to keep a tight rein on marketers, who, out of fear for their jobs, may become overly conservative, overthink decisions, or not take enough risks.
Like the Grateful Dead, marketers today need to experiment in their craft in order to make big breakthroughs. Instead of seeing failure as something to be avoided, CEOs and management teams need to free their marketers to experiment, quickly learn from failure, and experiment again. P39

RUN EXPERIMENTS IN YOUR MARKETING DEPARTMENT
Like music, marketing is a creative discipline. Instead of worrying about making mistakes, you should be doing at least five times more experiments than you are likely doing today. In terms of marketing, this could mean starting a blog, freeing your employees to Tweet or write posts for your blog, or leaving comments on others' blogs. You could start your own weekly podcast or TV show or create a new tool that gives people information they can use in their day-to-day jobs. The key to all of this is that you learn from your mistakes!
ACTION: Reframe your planning cycle in your company. It is okay to have an annual marketing budget, but plan your activities in monthly
"sprints" in which you execute your projects for 19 days a month, spend one day a month learning from the previous months' projects, and then selecting the next month's projects. When you pick your projects for the next month, make sure that at least 20 percent of them are purely experimental. P42

In every industry, there is a barely distinguishable herd of competitors that move in unison. Don't fall into the trap of moving in lockstep with that herd. Rather than try to outperform your competition in your existing industry, follow the Grateful Dead's recipe and create a new industry by reconstructing your market's boundaries.
The problem with innovating within industry boundaries is that you end up spending huge sums of money trying to move the needle a few percentage points in terms of market share.
When a boundary-changing newcomer comes along, companies and their mildly differentiated products lose tremendous market share and sometimes die as seen when Blockbuster reacted too late to competition from the Internet, broadband, and the "content-on-demand" services provided by cable companies and Netflix. P55

REDEFINE YOUR INDUSTRY BOUNDARIES
Every industry has opportunities for creating new ways of doing business that can separate your company from your competition and place you in your own unique category. Just as Y Combinator put some real thought into how VC and angel funding wasn't helping start-ups, and thus created a completely new category that is being followed by new groups like Techstars, you, too, must develop a similar approach to your industry.
ACTION: Redefining your industry boundaries is not an easy task.
Rather than try to tell you how to do it, we will pose some questions for you to ask yourself to get your ideas flowing.
In addition to thinking about your industry competitors, what are the
"altematives" to your product? Can you find ways to erase the traditional "boundaries" of your industry by incorporating or subsuming or competing with some of the altematives? P58

CULTIVATE ECCENTRICS
Have you noticed that people who are passionate about something are eager to talk it up, just like fans of the Grateful Dead want to talk up their favorite band? Your job is to create an experience that's unique, one that eccentrics will gravitate to, and one that they want to talk up.
ACTION: Build personality into your web site. Remove any content that looks similar to your competitors'. Delete what's boring. Make sure your web site, blog posts, newsletters, and e-mails are unlike all others in the marketplace. Being unique will make you stand out. Build up the information (videos, blog posts, e-books, and photos) that appeals to eccentrics in your marketplace. P66

There were interesting subgroups wandering along as part of the larger odyssey that was the Grateful Dead experience.
At many shows you saw Deaf Heads, people who could not hear the music but felt it through balloons that they held in front of them. As one would expect from a community as inclusive as Deadheads, many people who were not hearing-impaired learned how to sign "hello" to their fellow travelers. Spinners, another subgroup, enjoyed finding a bit of open space in the venue to spin, and spin... and spin ... in ecstasy to the music. It was a common sight that brought smiles to everyone's faces. The band noticed the Spinners and began installing speakers in the concourse area of the concert arenas so the spinners could enjoy quality sound, too, making Spinners true traveling companions on the odyssey instead of outliers. P73

LOSE CONTROL OF YOUR MARKETING MESSAGES
If you're to build a base of dedicated fans who will join you on an odyssey of success, you will need to lose control. Let your community define you, rather than trying to dictate what's said and how about your company. For example, you could work with bloggers, people who create and post videos onto YouTube, and other people active in social media. If you have a product or service that lends itself to providing free samples, find people to share it with and let them write about you. Or invite bloggers to your company to meet with staff or have an interview with your CEO or product designer. When you let others define and talk about you, it is more likely that a community will develop. And by all means when a community does develop (like the "spinners" at a Dead show), embrace what they have created and help it along (like the band did when they installed speakers for the spinners).
You can also get out into the marketplace and interact with the community as equals. Like Jake Burton and the Grateful Dead, both David and Brian also spend around 100 days each year with our community-we speak at events, participate in discussions, and hang out at Tweetups.
ACTION: Remove made-up, gobbledygook-laden mission statements, boierplate press releases, and other top-down messaging from your materials and web sites. Instead, point people to your community: the conferences, forums, chat rooms, and blogs of the people who talk you up. Then get out into your community and interact regularly. P76/76

Put Fans in the Front Row
If you're like us, you've been to concerts by many rock bands besides the Grateful Dead. Back in the day (prior to the Web), getting tickets for popular shows meant standing in line hours before the 10:00 A.M. on-sale time at the Ticketron outlet in your hometown. Or you could try your luck by calling the telephone number at 10:00, hoping you could get through and that tickets were available by the time you got off hold to speak to a representative. For popular bands, electronic ticketing meant that ticket scalpers would end up with the best seats, while fans often couldn't get tickets at all. This made it nearly impossible for the true fans to get up front at shows.
Unlike nearly every other band, the Grateful Dead controlled the ticket sales for their concerts. While other bands moved toward selling tickets through electronic systems of the day, like Ticketron and, later, Ticketmaster, the Grateful Dead established their own in-house ticketing agency in the early 1980s.
The unique ticketing system of the Grateful Dead led to word-of-mouth marketing like this: "Want some great seats to the Grateful Dead concert? You can buy tickets directly from the band. I know their phone number!" Fans would call a special telephone number to hear a recording about the upcoming tour and then mail in ticket requests, along with money orders, directly to the Grateful Dead ticketing office in San Rafael, California. The best seats were then mailed to those in the know, the fans who knew the drill and were motivated to go to the post office, get a money order, and follow the ticket request procedures. For most gigs, blocks of tickets were also sold at the venue box office and through the electronic ticketing systems. But the best seats always went to the band's biggest fans. P79/80

Always remember, your most passionate fans are also the people who tell your stories and spread your ideas. P81

CREATE EXCLUSIVE PROGRAMS FOR YOUR MOST LOYAL SUPPORTERS
Every organization should be thinking about how to cultivate its most loyal supporters and treat them as special. This approach need not be as formalized as the airline frequent flyer programs. Many times, simply alerting existing customers first with news and announcements is enough. Certainly, all companies should rethink the common practice used with telecommunications companies, newspapers, and magazines of offering cheaper rates new subscribers than to current ones.
ACTION: Identify your most loyal customers and add them to a database so that you can reach them. What can you offer them that would be valuable and not available to the general public?
Communicate to this loyal group first. Before your next product release, do a special event, teleconference, or webinar for your existing customers. Let them know first, before you alert the media and other constituents. P85

Extend your reach
Like the Grateful Dead, you should be an early adopter in your industry of ways to increase your reach in your marketplace. Since it's 2010 and not 1990, this means you should stop obsessing over your e-mail database and start enlarging your view of your "each" by focusing on your blog subscribers, Twitter followers, Facebook fans, and Linkedin Group members.
ACTION: Make a chart that shows the total  number of names on your email list plus your biog subscribers, latter followers, Facebook fans. and LinkedIn Group members. Update your chart monthly and make it part of your standard reporting and metics. Create a goal for yourself of growing your overall reach by 5 percent per month. P93

Most industries "grew up" with a distribution model that involved a layer or two of middlemen (i.e., brokers) between them and the customer. These layers were necessary because the brokers were "feet on the street" in the local markets and were nearer to the end-customer than the product producer.
The Internet has flipped this concept on its head. Being located physically near the end-user is much less valuable today than it was traditionally, as you can now reach and service end-customers through the Internet much more efficiently. For some industries, having middlemen between the product-maker and the end-user is still important if they are combining your product with other products and services in truly clever ways to add meaningful value. Having said that, in many industries, middlemen are just not adding the same amount of value today that they used to. THE GRATEFUL DEAD TEACHES US TO STRIP AWAY THE LAYERS BETWEEN US AND OUR CUSTOMERS
AND TO PULL THEM IN DIRECTLY. P99

The only way to truly determine the demand curve for your product is to try different price points with different customer sets over time to see where the break points are. As a marketer, it's important that you experiment with raising and lowering your prices to figure out the ideal configuration of pricing and packaging in order to maximize profit. When you go through brokers, it limits your ability to experiment with that pricing as it's difficult to get brokers to move their price points around. And, too, they'll often absorb the benefits of any price decrease experiments. P100

CONNECT DIRECTLY WITH YOUR CUSTOMERS
The Internet allows you to connect directly with your customers and can help you remove the margin-stripping layers inherent in a distribution channel. As a business owner or marketer, if you can remove these layers, you can increase your margins, increase control of your pricing and demand curve, and increase your authentic transparency with your end-users.
ACTION: If you make a product or service and sell it through brokers or distributors, ask yourself if that construct still makes sense in light of the fact that the Internet likely enables you to sell and service your offering much more efficiently (cheaply) than ever before. If you're starting a new business, do not assume that your industry's conventional wisdom about distribution strategy is right, as you might be able to jump over your industry's existing protagonists by skipping the middle-man. If you're a broker or middleman yourself, don't wear rose-colored glasses-you had better make sure that you add meaningful, unique value that is well beyond the capabilities of the manufacturer of the product or service that you're distributing. P102

YOU GOTTA GIVE TO GET
Great free stuff acts like a magnet as it both draws people to you and opens up the top of your marketing funnel in a dramatic way. Basically, the freemium model that the Grateful Dead pioneered, and companies like MySQL applied to the software industry, can work in any industry, even yours.
ACTION: Create a great e-book about your industry (not your product) that people will want to share with others. Create a brilliant video about how your industry will evolve over the next 10 years and post it on your blog and on YouTube. Do an industry survey to collect information about some interesting topic and create a remarkable report on it that your industry will love. Find a low-cost developer (try [Rentacoder.com](http://rentacoder.com/)) and build an application for the iPhone or the Web that will give your market great pleasure (see [www.websitegrader.com](http://www.websitegrader.com/) as an elaborate example).
Write a fantastic blog article once a week about your industry (not your product).
If this content you create is remarkable, it will draw visitors to your business in a far more dramatic way than the product or services page on your web site will ever do. P111

No band freely shared their music with fans the way the Grateful Dead did and as we've already pointed out, rather than working against them, setting their music free only fueled their success as Deadheads spread their music far and wide. Each tape was like an advertisement that attracted new people to one of their concerts. The more concerts the Grateful Dead performed, the more tapes were in the marketplace. The more copies were made of the tapes, the more advertisements were in the marketplace pulling in new customers. P114

DEVELOP A FREE OFFERING 
If you work in a software company, are part of an information business, or have an offering that can be delivered through the Web, you should be developing a free version and offering it on the Web with an upgrade path to a premium offering.
ACTION: Develop a free mobile application for your business.
For businesses that sell physical goods or services that cannot be delivered via the Web, you should consider developing a free mobile application for BlackBerry devices, iPhones, and other devices. For example, Stanley Black & Decker, one of the world's largest hand-tool and power-tool manufacturers, offers a free level application on the iPhone. Consumers use the level for such things as checking if a picture is hanging straight on a wall. The premium version, of course, is a more accurate professional-grade level from Stantey Black & Decker, and you have to pay for that at your local hardware store. P125

SET YOUR DESIGNERS FREE
ACTION: Give your designers leeway to play with your branding elements and invite customers and followers to share their ideas, You can maintain strict control over your brand in-house, but you quickly lose control once your brand is online. Let people use your theme song in videos and add your logo to blog posts, Instead of fighting back, post the more creative videos and other content to your web site. Or why not crowdsource the next design that you need by announcing a contest for young designers to take a crack at, say, your tradeshow booth graphics. No matter what you do with outside people, you should certainly let your in-house and chief outside designers come up with new ideas that loosen up your brand. while still maintaining your corporate image. P133

In a previous chapter, we talked about cutting out the mid-dleman. Recall that we discussed how the Grateful Dead sold tickets directly to fans. Now in this chapter, we're suggesting that you partner with entrepreneurs in the way that the Grateful Dead did with merchandise sellers. At first glance, these strategies may seem contradictory. They're not. Instead, they are two different strategies. While ticket brokers acted as a monopoly (until the Dead broke it) and made money from tickets to the bands shows that would have sold anyway, the merchandise sellers, who were not acting as a monopoly, were adding to the availability of goods. Each style of T-shirt, coffee cup, sweatshirt, and pin was a bit different. Just as important, the ticket brokers were huge corporations, not Grateful Dead fans. The merchandise sellers were entrepreneurial fans. P138

When the Grateful Dead began licensing sellers of logo merchandise, many observers thought the program foolish because the band was thought to be reducing its overall revenue. But band members decided it was better to get more logos out there and to keep the community happy than to make a few more dollars. They figured, rightly of course, that the money would come as the band became even more popular. For the Grateful Dead, the strategy was wildly successful. P140

PARTNER WITH THOSE WHO ARE EAGER TO SELL YOUR STUFF
Do you have people selling versions of your products and services that seem in competition to your direct sales efforts? Maybe the right thing to do is to partner with those entrepreneurs rather than sending them a legal notice. What about companies that sell services related to yours?
Is there an opportunity there?
ACTION: Get with your legal staff and make it clear that you want to review any cease-and-desist action before it is implemented. In many organizations, the initial reaction-to say "no" - is implemented before anyone has a chance to review the decision. Better yet, proactively find and approach companies that seem to be competitors and work out a way to help one another. If you're a realtor, why not forge a partnership with a home improvement company. Manufacturers or retailers of baby and children products should work out a deal to sell merchandise on so-called "Mommy-blogger" sites. P141

GIVE BACK TO YOUR COMMUNITY
Of course most of us don't have the ability to perform benefit concerts in front of 20,000 people, nor are we likely to work within a huge company that can invest in a Ronald McDonald's House-sized effort. Don't let that stop you from giving back! Follow the lead of the Grateful Dead and give back in your area of expertise. For example, we frequently speak as guest lecturers at colleges and universities in the Boston area. We feel that providing our ideas to students at Harvard, MIT, Boston University, Simmons, Babson, Emerson, and other institutions is a worthwhile way for us to personally give back to our community. It not only benefits the students but positively benefits us too.
In addition, we're donating 25 percent of our royalties from this book to the Grateful Dead Archive at the University of California, Santa Cruz, to support further study of the Grateful Dead in business, society, and music.
ACTION: Pick a way to give back to your community in some form that is consistent with your brand and start doing it now. P148
