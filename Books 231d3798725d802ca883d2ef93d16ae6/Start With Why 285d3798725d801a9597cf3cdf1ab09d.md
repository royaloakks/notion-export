# Start With Why

Most of the answers we get, when based on sound evidence, are perfectly valid. However, if we're starting with the wrong questions, if we don't understand the cause, then even the right answers will always steer us wrong ... eventually. The truth, you see, is always revealed... eventually.
The stories that follow are of those individuals and organizations that embody this pattern. They are the ones that start with Why. P1 

Just about every person or organization needs to motivate oth ers to act for some reason or another. Some want to motivate a purchase decision. Others are looking for support or a vote. Still others are keen to motivate the people around them to work harder or smarter or just follow the rules. The ability to motivate people is not, in itself, difficult. It is usually tied to some external factor. Tempting incentives or the threat of punishment will often elicit the behavior we desire. P6

Great leaders, in contrast, are able to inspire people to act.
Those who are able to inspire give people a sense of purpose or belonging that has little to do with any external incentive or benefit to be gained. Those who truly lead are able to create a following of people who act not because they are swayed but because they are inspired. They are able to create a following of people-supporters, voters, customers, workers-who act for the good of the whole not because they have so, but because they want to.
Those who are inspired are often willing to pay a premium, put up with inconvenience and sometimes even endure personal suffer-ing. For those who are inspired, the motivation to act is deeply personal. P6

Not only bad decisions are made on false assumptions. Sometimes when things go right, we think we know why. But do we really? That a result goes the way we want it to does not mean we can repeat it over and over. I have a friend who invests some of his own money. Whenever he does well, it's because of his brains and ability to pick the right stocks, at least according to him. But when he loses money, he always blames the market. I have no issue with either line of logic, but either his successes and failures hinge upon his own prescience and blindness or they hinge upon good and bad luck. It can't be both. P13

There's barely a product or service on the market today that customers can't buy from someone else for about the same price, with about the same quality, the same level of service and about the same features. If you truly have a first-mover's advantage, it's probably lost in a matter of months. If you offer something actually novel, someone else will soon come up with something similar and maybe even better.
But if you ask most businesses why their customers are their customers, most will tell you it's because of superior quality, fea-tures, price or service. In other words, most companies have no clue why their customers are their customers. This is a fascinating realization. If companies don't know why their customers are their customers, odds are good that they don't know why their employ. ees are their employees either.
If most companies don't really know why their customers are their customers or why their employees are their employees, then how do they know how to attract more customers and employees or encourage loyalty among those they already have? P16

Fear, real or perceived, is arguably the most powerful manipulation of the lot. P22

When fear is employed, facts are incidental. Deeply seated in our biological drive to survive, that emotion cannot be quickly wiped away with facts and figures. This is how terrorism works.
Though the statistical probability that we could get hurt by a terrorist is quite low, it is the fear that it might happen that paralyzes a population.
Again, perhaps the most powerful of all the manipulations, fear is often used with far less nefarious motivations. We use fear to raise our kids. We use fear to motivate people to obey a code of eth-ics. Fear is regularly used in public service ads, say to promote child safety or the need to wear seat belts. There used to be a famous PSA to help combat drug abuse among teenagers. A man stood facing the camera holding an egg. "This is your brain," he said. Then he cracked the egg into a hot frying pan. It sizzled and spluttered.
"This is your brain on drugs," he continued. "Any questions?" And another ad intended to scare the hell out of any brash teenager:
"Cocaine doesn't make you sexy ... it makes you dead." P22

If anyone has ever tried to sell you anything by stoking your fear of missing out, being left out or even dying, they are putting a proverbial gun to your head to help you see the "value" of choosing their product. Or perhaps it's just a banana. P23

Our impatience often pushes us to implement short-term responses to our long-term desires. A management consultant friend of mine was hined by a billion-dollar company to help it fulfill is goals and aspirations. The problem was, she explained, no matter the issoe, the company's managers were ahways drawa to the quicker. cheaper option over the better long-term solution. Just like the habitual dieter, "they never have the time or money to do it right the first time," she said of her client, "but they always have the time and money to do it again.” P24

Given the money and fame that go with it, the social pressure to want to exert social pressure seems to have replaced aspirations to be almost anything else. A 2019 study found that a whopping 86 percent of thirteen-to-thirty-eight-year-olds aspire to be "in-fluencers" (and 12 percent of them already think they are). P26

When a company offers too many options for the same product, it is a sure sign they are using novelty to help drive their sales. Novelty is a quick fix because it's easy to produce. Real inno-vation, in contrast, is special, different and rare. When something is actually innovative, the choice is obvious. P28

Manipulations don't build loyalty, but they do cost money.
Lots of money. And when money is not as available to fund those tactics, not having a loyal following can cost a company even more. P30

P37

The Golden Circle finds order and predictability in human behavior. Put sim-ply, it helps us understand why we do what we do. The Golden Circle provides compelling evidence of how much more we can achieve if we remind ourselves to start everything we do by first asking why. P38

And it all starts from the inside out. It all starts with Why.
Before we explore the applications of The Golden Circle, let me first define the terms, starting from the outside of the circle and moving inward.
WHAT: Every single company, organization and individual on the planet knows WHAT they do. This is true no matter how big or small, no matter what industry. Every one of us can easily describe the products or services our companies sell or the jobs we do. WHATs are easy to identify.
HOW: Some companies and people know HOW they do WHAT they do. Whether you call them a "differentiating value proposi-tion," "proprietary process," "unique selling proposition" or "your strengths," HOWs are often given to explain how something is different or better. Not as obvious as WHATs, many think these are the differentiating or motivating factors in a decision. It would be false to assume they are all that is required to inspire people to act. There is one missing detail:
WHY: Very few people or companies can clearly articulate WHY they do WHAT they do. When I say WHY, I don't mean to make money—that's a result. By WHY I mean what is your purpose, cause or belief? WHY does your company exist? WHY do you get out of bed every morning? And WHY should anyone care?
Most of us think, act or communicate from the outside in, from WHAT to WHY. And for good reason—we go from the clearest thing to the fuzziest thing. We say WHAT we do, we sometimes say HOW we do it, but we rarely say WHY we do WHAT we do. P39

Let's look at that Apple example again and rewrite it in the order Apple actually communicated. This time, the example starts with WHY.
In everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo.
We believe in thinking differently.
The way we challenge the status quo is by making our products beautifully designed, simple to use and user-friendly.
And we happen to make great computers.
Wanna buy one?
It's a completely different message. It actually feels different from the first one. We're much more eager to buy a computer from Apple after reading the second version—and all I did was reverse the order of the information. There's no trickery, no ma-nipulation, no free stuff, no aspirational messages, no celebrities.
Apple didn't simply reverse the order of information: their message started with WHY, a purpose, cause or belief that had nothing to do with WHAT they did. WHAT they did-the products they made, from computers to small electronics—no longer served as the reason to buy, they served as the tangible proof of their cause. P41

People don't buy WHAT you do, they buy
WHY you do it. P41

Apple did not invent the MP3, nor did they invent the technology that became the iPod, yet they are credited with transforming the music industry with it. The original multi-gigabyte portable hard drive music player was actually the Zen, invented by Creative Technology Ltd., a Singapore-based technology company that rose to prominence by making the Sound Blaster audio technology that enables home PCs to have sound. In fact, Apple didn't introduce the iPod until twenty-two months after Creative's entry into the market. This detail alone calls into question the assumption of a first mover's advantage. Given their history in digital sound, Creative was more qualified than Apple to introduce a digital music product. The problem was, they advertised their product as a "5GB MP3 player." It is exactly the same message as Apple's "1,000 songs in your pocket." The difference is Creative told us WHAT their product was and Apple told us WHY we needed it. P44

For all those who will try to convince you that Apple computers are just better, I cannot dispute a single claim. All I can offer is that most of the factors that they believe make them better meet their standard of what a computer should do. With that in mind, Macintoshes are, in practice, only better for those who believe what Apple believes. Those people who share Apple's WHY believe that Apple's products are objectively better, and any attempt to convince them otherwise is pointless. Even with objective metrics in hand, the argument about which is better or which is worse without first establishing a common standard creates nothing more than debate. Loyalists for each brand will point to various features and benefits that matter to them (or don't matter to them) in an attempt to convince the other that they are right. And that's one of the primary reasons why so many companies feel the need to differentiate in the first place-based on the flawed assumption that only one group can be right. But what if both parties were right? What if an Apple was right for some people and a PC was right for others? It's not a debate about better or worse anymore, it's a discussion about different needs. And before the discussion can even happen, the WHYs for each must be established first. P49

In all cases, going back to the original purpose, cause or belief will help these industries adapt. Instead of asking "WHAT should we do to compete?" the questions must be asked, "WHY did we start doing WHAT we're doing in the first place, and WHAT can we do to bring our cause to life considering all the technologies and market opportunities available today?" But don't take my word for it. None of this is my opinion. It is all firmly grounded in the tenets of biology. P51

Our need to belong is not rational, but it is a constant that exists across all people in all cultures. It is a feeling we get when those around us share our values and beliefs. When we feel like we belong we feel connected and we feel safe. As humans we crave the feeling and we seek it out. P53

Our desire to feel like we belong is so powerful that we will go to great lengths, do irrational things and sometimes, like the Sneetches, spend money to get that feeling. We want to be around people and organizations who are like us and share our beliefs.
When companies talk about WHAT they do and how advanced their products are, these things may appeal to us, but they do not necessarily represent something to which we want to belong. But when a company clearly communicates their WHY, what they be-lieve, and if we believe what they believe, then we will sometimes go to great lengths to include those products or brands in our lives. This is not because they are better but because they become markers or symbols of the values and beliefs we hold dear.
Our natural need to belong also makes us good at spotting things that don't belong. It's a sense we get. A feeling. Something deep inside us, something we can't put into words, allows us to feel how some things just fit and some things just don't. Dell selling MP3 players just didn't feel right because Dell defined itself as a computer company, so the only things that belonged were com-puters. Apple defined itself as a company on a higher mission, and so anything they did that fit that definition felt like it belonged. In 2004, they produced a promotional iPod in partnership with the iconoclastic Irish rock band U2. That made sense. They would never have produced a promotional iPod with Barbra Streisand, even though she's sold vastly more records than U2 and may have a bigger audience. U2 and Apple belonged together because they shared the same values and beliefs. They both pushed boundaries. P54

Companies that fail to communicate a sense of WHY force us to make decisions with only empirical evidence. This is why those decisions take more time, feel difficult or leave us uncertain. Under these conditions, manipulative strategies that exploit our de-sires, fears, doubts or fantasies work very well. We're forced to make these less-than-inspiring decisions for one simple reason— these companies don't offer us anything else besides the facts and figures, features and benefits upon which to base our decisions.
They don't tell us WHY. P58

We all know someone who is a die-hard Mac lover. Ask them WHY they love their Mac. They won't tell you "Well, I see myself 

as someone who likes to challenge the status quo, and it's important for me to surround myself with the people, products and brands that prove to the outside world who I believe I am." Bio-logically, that's what happened. But their purchase decision was made in the part of the brain that controls behavior not language.
So they will provide a rationalization: "It's the user interface. It's the simplicity. It's the design. It's the high quality. They're the best computers. I'm a creative person." In reality, their purchase decision and their loyalty are deeply personal. They don't really care about Apple; it's all about how they see themselves. P62/63

Remember the Honda and the Ferrari? Products are not just symbols of what the company believes, they also serve as symbols of what the loyal buyers believe. Not too long ago, people with Apple laptops, for example, loved opening them up while sitting in an airport. They liked that everyone knew they were using a Mac. It was an emblem, a symbol of who they were. That glowing Apple logo said something about them and how they saw the world. Did anyone notice when someone popped open the lid of their Dell computer? No! Not even the people using the computer cared. Dell had a fuzzy sense of WHY, so their products and their brands didn't symbolize anything about the users. P63

Products with a clear sense of WHY give people a way to tell the outside world who they are and what they believe. Again, people don't buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it. If a company does not have a clear sense of WHY, then it is impossible for the outside world to perceive anything more than WHAT the company does. And when that happens, manipulations that rely on pushing price, features, service or quality become the primary currency of differentiation. P64

Starting with WHY is just the beginning. There is still work to be done before a person or an organization has the ability to in-spire. For The Golden Circle to work, each of the pieces must be in balance and in the right order. P65

For values or guiding principles to be truly effective they have to be actions. It's not "integrity," it's "do the right thing." It's not
"innovation," it's "look at the problem from a different angle." It's not "honesty," it's "tell the truth." Articulating our values as verbs gives us clearer direction on how to act in any situation. We can hold each other accountable to measure our values or even build incentives around them. Asking people to have integrity doesn't guarantee that their decisions will always keep customers' or clients' best interests in mind; telling them to always do the right thing does. P67

The WHY serves as a compass for the long journey and the HOW guides the route we choose, the steps we have to take, along the way. P67

Consistency of WHAT
A WHY is a belief. It lives in our imagination. HOWs are the actions we take to realize that belief. But we live in the tangible world. Everything we say and everything we do has to prove what we believe. WHATs are the tangible results of our actions: our products, services, marketing, PR, culture and whom we hire, everything people can see. If people don't buy WHAT you do but WHY you do it, then all these things must be consistent. The only way people will know what we believe is by the things we say and do, and if we're not consistent in the things we say and do, no one will know what we believe.
It is at the WHAT level that authenticity happens. "Authentic-ity" is that word so often bandied about in the corporate and political worlds. Everyone talks about the importance of being authentic. "You must be authentic," experts say. "All the trend data shows that people prefer to do business with authentic brands*
"People vote for the authentic candidate." "That marketing piece you're working on," a CEO might instruct, "please make it a little more authentic." The problem is, that instruction is totally un-actionable.
So what do companies do to be authentic?
The common solution is hilarious to me. They go out and do customer research and they ask the customers, what would we have to tell you for us to be authentic? This entirely misses the point. You can't ask others what you have to do to be authentic.
Being authentic means that you already know who you are and what you stand for. What does a politician say when told to be
"more authentic"? How does a leader act more "authentically"?
Without a clear understanding of WHY, the instruction is completely useless.
What authenticity means is that our Golden Circle is in bal-ance. It means that everything we say and everything we do we actually believe. This goes for management as well as employees.
Only when that happens can the things we say and do be viewed as authentic. Apple believed that its original Apple computer and its Macintosh challenged the dominant IBM DOS platforms.
Apple believed that its iPod and iTunes products were challenging the status quo in the music industry. And we all understood WHY Apple did what it did. It was because of that mutual understanding that we viewed those Apple products as authentic. P67/68

Ask the best salesperson what it takes to be a great salesper-son. They will always tell you that it helps when you really believe in the product you're selling. What does belief have to do with a sales job? Simple. When salespeople actually believe in the things they are selling, the words that come out of their mouths are au-thentic. When belief enters the equation, passion exudes. It is this authenticity that produces the relationships upon which all the best sales organizations are based. Relationships also build trust.
And with trust comes loyalty. Without a balanced Golden Circle, there is no authenticity, which means no strong relationships, which means no trust. And you're back at square one selling on price, service, quality or features. You are back to being like everyone else. Worse, without that authenticity, companies are more likely to resort to manipulation: pricing, promotions, social pres-sure, fear, take your pick. P69

It's hard to make a case to someone that your products or services are important in their lives based on external rational factors that you have defined as valuable (remember the Ferrari versus the Honda). However, if your WHY and our WHY corre-spond, then we will see your products and services as tangible ways to prove what we believe. When WHY, HOW and WHAT are in balance, authenticity is achieved and we feel fulfilled. When they are out of balance, stress or uncertainty exists. And when that happens, the decisions we make will also be out of balance.
Without WHY, we are more easily motivated by aspiration or fear. At that point, it is we, the buyers, who are at the greatest risk of ending up being inauthentic. If we buy something that doesn't clearly embody our own sense of WHY, then those around us have little evidence to paint a clear and accurate picture of who we are. P74

When we can only provide a rational basis for a decision, when we can only point to tangible elements or rational measurements, the highest level of confidence we can give is "I think this is the right decision." That would be biologically accurate because we re acti vating the neocortex, the "thinking" part of our brain. At a neocor tical level we can verbalize our thoughts. This is what's happening when we spend all that time sifting through the pros and cons. listening to all the differences between one product or another when we're reading all the reviews.
When we make gut decisions, the highest level of confidence we can offer is "The decision feels right," even if it flies in the face of all the facts and figures. Again, this is biologically accurate, because gut decisions happen in the part of the brain that controls our emotions and decision-making, not language. Ask the most successful entrepreneurs and leaders what their secret is and invariably most say the same thing: "I trust my gut." The times things went wrong, they will tell you, "I listened to what others were telling me, even though it didn't feel right. I should have trusted my gut." It's a good strategy, except it's not scalable. The gut decision can only be made by a single person. P78/79

The reason the human race has been so successful is not because we're the strongest animals—far from it. Size and might alone do not guarantee success. We've succeeded as a species because of our ability to form cultures. Cultures are groups of people who come together around a common set of values and beliefs. When we share values and beliefs with others, we form trust. Trust allows us to rely on others to help protect our children and ensure our personal survival. The ability to leave the den to hunt or ex-plore, with confidence that the community will protect our family and our stuff until we return, is one of the most important factors in our survival as individuals and the advancement of our species. P88/89

The same can be said for any place that has a strong culture or recognizable personality. We do better in cultures in which we feel like we belong. We do better in places that reflect our own values and beliefs.
Now consider what a company is. A company is a culture. A group of people brought together around a common set of values and beliefs. It's not products or services that bind a company together. It's not size and might that make a company strong, it's the culture-the strong sense of beliefs and values that everyone, from the CEO to the receptionist, all share. So the logic follows, the goal is not to hire people who simply have a skill set you need, the goal is to hire people who, first, believe what you believe. The goal is not to take a job simply because one company pays you more than another, the goal is to work in a culture that, first, believes what you believe. P90/91

Apple did not have a lock on good ideas; there are smart, innovative thinkers at most companies. But great companies give their people a purpose or challenge around which to develop ideas rather than simply instructing them to "be more innovative." Companies with a clear sense of WHY tend to ignore their competi-tion, whereas those with a fuzzy sense of WHY are obsessed with what others are doing. They study their competitors in hopes of adding the features and benefits that will make their products bet-ter, only further entrenching themselves in WHAT they do. This is how companies like Colgate find themselves with forty-one different types of toothpaste (not including the ten for kids). P101

Herb Kelleher, the visionary behind Southwest Airlines, understood this better than most. He recognized that to get the best out of his employees he needed to create an environment in which they felt like the company cared about them. He knew that they would naturally excel if they felt the work they did made a differ-ence. When a journalist asked Kelleher who came first to him, his shareholders or his employees, his response was heresy at the time (and to a large degree still is). "Well, that's easy," he said, "employees come first, and if employees are treated right, they treat the outside world right, the outside world uses the company's product again, and that makes the shareholders happy. That really is the way that it works and it's not a conundrum at all.” P111/112

Whom do you trust more, someone you know or someone you don't know? What do you trust more, a claim made in a piece of advertising or a recommendation from a friend? Whom do you trust more, the waiter who tells you "Everything on the menu is great," or the waiter who tells you to avoid the chicken casserole?
Are these questions too easy? Then how about this one: Why should anyone trust you?
The feeling of trust is lodged squarely in the same place as the WHY-the limbic brain-and it's often powerful enough to trump empirical research, or at least seed doubt. And it is that limbic brain that is constantly evaluating everything we hear, trying to assess if we can trust what we hear or if we need to exercise can-tion. This means that everyone else's brain is doing the same thing when we say anything
Personal recommendations go a long way. We trust the judg ment of others. And those we know trust us. It's part of the fabric of strong cultures. But we don't trust the judgement of just anyone.
We are more likely to trust those who share our values and beliefs. And when we believe someone has our best interest in mind because it is in their best interest to do so, the whole group benefits. The advancements of societies depend a great deal on the trust shared between those with a common set of values and beliefs. P112

In his 1962 book Diffusion of Innovations, Everett M. Rogers was the first to formally describe how innovations spread through society. Thirty years later, in his book Crossing the Chasm, Geoffrey Moore expanded on Rogers's ideas to apply the principle to high-tech product marketing. But the Law of Diffusion of Innovations explains much more than just the spread of innovation or technology. It explains the spread of ideas.
If you don't know the law, you're likely already familiar with some of its terminology. Our population is broken into five seg. ments that fall across a bell curve: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority and laggards. P117

![IMG_3816.jpeg](Start%20With%20Why%20285d3798725d801a9597cf3cdf1ab09d/IMG_3816.jpeg)

P117

loyalty is when people are willing to suffer some inconvenience or pay a premium to do business with you, sometimes even turn down a better offer from someone else. Something the later majority rarely does. P121

According to the Law of Diffusion, mass-market success can only be achieved after you penetrate between 15 percent and 18 percent of the market. That's because, according to Rogers, the carly majority won't try something new until someone else has tried it first. Once you hit that critical mass, a social phenomenon happens: the tipping point just tips. It is at this point that a product gains mass-market acceptance, a company becomes more stable or an idea becomes a movement. When that happens, the growth is not only exponential, it is automatic. It just goes.
The goal of business then should not be to try to sell to anyone who might buy our product-the majority-but rather to find people who believe what we believe, the left side of the bell curve.
They perceive greater value in what we do and will happily pay a premium or suffer some sort of inconvenience to be a part of our cause. They are the ones who, of their own volition, will tell others about us. That 15 to 18 percent is not made up of people who are simply willing to pay for what we're offering. It is the percentage of people who share our beliefs and want to incorporate our ideas, our products, our services or our brand into their own lives as WHATs to their own WHYs. They look to WHAT we do as a tangible element that demonstrates their own purpose, cause or be. lief to the outside world. Their willingness to pay a premium or suffer inconvenience to use our product or service says more about them than it does about us and our products. Their ability to easily see WHY they need to incorporate our products into their lives makes this group the most loyal customers. They are also the most loyal sharcholders and the most loyal employees.
No matter where they sit in the spectrum, these are the people who not only love us but talk about us. Get enough of the people on the left side of the curve on our side and they encourage the rest to follow. P122

We've got a new product.
It pauses live TV.
Skips commercials.
Rewinds live TV.
Memorizes your viewing habits and records shows on your behalf without your needing to set it.

Compare the original list of features and benefits with a revised message that starts with WHY:

If you're the kind of person who likes to have total control over every aspect of your life, boy do we have a product for you.
It pauses live TV.
Skips commercials.
Rewinds live TV.
Memorizes your viewing habits and records shows on your behalf without your needing to set it. P124/125

 

In this version, all the features and rational benefits serve as tangible proof of WHY the product exists, not the reasons to buy, per se. The WHY is the belief that drives the decision, and WHAT it does provides us a way to rationalize the appeal of the product. P125

It wasn't the details of his plans that earned him the right to lead. It was what he believed and his ability to communicate it clearly that people followed. In essence, he, like all great leaders, became the symbol of the belief. Dr. King came to personify the cause. To this day we build statues of him to keep that belief alive and tangible. People followed him not because of his idea of a changed America. People followed him because of their idea of a changed America. The part of the brain that influences our behavior and decisions does not have the capacity for language. We have trouble saying clearly, in emotional terms, why we do what we do and offer rationalizations that, though valid and true, are not powerful enough to inspire others. So when asked why they showed up that day, people said simply, "Because I believe." More than anything else, what Martin Luther King Jr. gave us was clarity, a way to explain how we felt. He gave us the words that inspired us. He gave us something to believe in, something we could easily share with our friends. Everyone at the Mall that day shared a set of values and beliefs. And everyone there that day. regardless of skin color or sex, showed up with common cause. It was that shared belief that fueled a movement to change a nation. P129

Energy can motivate. It is easy to see, easy to measure and easy to copy. Charisma, in contrast, is hard to define, near impossible to measure and difficult to copy. But charisma is what we need if we want to inspire. Charisma has nothing to do with energy. Energy comes from a good night's sleep or lots of caffeine. Charisma comes from a clarity of WHY, from absolute conviction in an ideal bigger than oneself. P134

All great leaders have charisma because all great leaders start with WHY. It wasn't Bill Gates's passion for computers that inspired us when he led Microsoft, it was his undying optimism that even the most complicated problems could be solved. He believed we could find ways to remove obstacles to ensure that everyone could live and work to their greatest potential. And that belief inspired his vision of a PC on every desk. It wasn't just that Gates saw the impact of WHAT the new technology could do; he also saw WHY we needed it. And that is what drew us to him. P134

When he stepped down as CEO of Microsoft in 2000, he established the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The work it does has nothing to do with software, but it is still bringing his WHY to life. The foundation's mission statement is "to create a world where every person has the opportunity to live a healthy, productive life." Whereas before Gates helped people live more productive lives with technology, today he does it through advancements in health. For Gates, all that has changed is WHAT he is doing to bring his cause to life. A charismatic leader can do many things, but their WHATs will always be ways to bring their WHY to life. P137

The cone represents a company or an organization-an inherently hierarchical and organized system. Sitting at the top of the system, representing the WHY, is a leader, the keeper of the vi-sion; in the case of a company, that's usually the CEO (or at least we hope it is). The next level down, the HOW level, typically includes the executives who are inspired by the vision and know HOW to bring it to life. Don't forget that a WHY is just a belief, HOWs are the actions we take to realize that belief and WHATS are the results of those actions. No matter how charismatic or inspiring the leader is, if there are not people in the organization inspired to bring that vision to reality, to build an infrastructure with systems and processes, then at best inefficiency reigns, and at worst failure results.
In this rendering the HOW level represents a person or a small group responsible for building the infrastructure that can make a WHY tangible. That may happen in operations, finance, market-ing, human resources and all the other C-suite departments. Beneath that, at the WHAT level, is where the rubber meets the road.
It is at this level that the majority of the employees sit and where all the tangible stuff actually happens. P138

WHY-types are the visionaries, the ones with the overactive imaginations. They tend to be optimists who believe that all the things they imagine can actually be accomplished. HOW-types live more in the here and now. They are the realists and have a clearer sense of all things practical. WHY-types are focused on the things most people can't see, like the distant future. HOW-types are focused on the realities of the present, the things most people can see. They also tend to be better at building structures and processes and getting things done. One is not better than the other, they are just different ways people naturally see and experience the world. Gates is a WHY-type. So were the Wright broth-ers. And Steve Jobs. And Herb Kelleher. But they didn't accomplish what they accomplished alone. They couldnt. They needed those who knew HOW. P141/142

For a message to have real impact, to affect behavior and seed loyalty, it needs more than publicity. It needs to publicize some higher purpose, cause or belief to which those with similar values and beliefs can relate. Only then can the message create any lasting mass-market success. For a stunt to appeal to the left side of the curve of the Law of Diffusion, WHY the stunt is being per-formed, beyond the desire to generate press, must be clear. Though there may be short-term benefits without clarity, loud is nothing more than excessive volume. Or in business vernacular: clutter.
And companies wonder why differentiation is such a challenge these days. Have you heard the volume coming from some of them? 

In contrast, what would have been the impact of Dr. King's speech had he not had a microphone and loudspeakers? His vision would have been no less clear. His words would have been no less inspiring. He knew what he believed and he spoke with passion and charisma about that belief. But only the few people with front-row seats would have been inspired by those words. A leader with a cause, whether it be an individual or an organization, must have a megaphone through which to deliver their message. And it must be clear and loud to work. Clarity of purpose, cause or belief is important, but it is equally important that people hear you. For a WHY to have the power to move people it must not only be clear, it must be amplified to reach enough people to tip the scale.
It's no coincidence that the three-dimensional Golden Circle is a cone. It is, in practice, a megaphone. An organization effectively becomes the vessel through which a person with a clear purpose, cause or belief can speak to the outside world. But for a megaphone to work, clarity must come first. Without a clear message, what will you amplify? P147

An organization is represented by the cone in the three-dimensional view of The Golden Circle. This organized system sits atop another system: the marketplace. The marketplace is made up of all the customers and potential customers, all the press, all the shareholders, all the competition, all the suppliers and all the money.
This system is inherently chaotic and disorganized. The only contact that the organized system has with the disorganized system is at the base—at the WHAT level. Everything an organization says and does, all the products and services that the company sells, all the marketing and advertising it puts out, communicates the leader's vision to the outside world. Again, people don't buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it, and if all the things happening at the WHAT level do not clearly represent WHY the company exists, then the ability to inspire is severely diminished.

Remember the biology of The Golden Circle. The WHY exists in the part of the brain that controls feelings and decision-making but not language. WHATs exist in the part of the brain that controls rational thought and language. Comparing the biology of the brain to the three-dimensional rendering of The Golden Circle reveals a profound insight. P159

P159

The leader sitting at the top of the organization is the inspira-tion, the symbol of the reason we do what we do. They represent the emotional limbic brain. WHAT the company says and does represents the rational thought and language of the neocortex.
Just as it is hard for people to speak their feelings, like someone trying to explain why they love their spouse, it is equally hard for an organization to explain its WHY. The part of the brain that controls feelings and the part that controls language are not the same. Given that the cone is simply a three-dimensional rendering of The Golden Circle, which is firmly grounded in the biology of human decision-making, the logic follows that organizations 

of any size will struggle to clearly communicate their WHY. Translated into business terms this means that trying to communicate your differentiating value proposition is really hard.
Put bluntly, the struggle that so many companies have to differentiate or communicate their true value to the outside world is not a business problem, it's a biology problem. Just like a person struggling to put their emotions into words, we rely on meta-phors, imagery and analogies to try to communicate how we feel.
Absent the proper language to share our deep emotions, our pur-pose, cause or belief, we tell stories. We use symbols. We create tangible things for those who believe what we believe to point to and say, "That's why I'm inspired." If done properly, the mar-keting, branding and products and services all serve as a clear megaphone-a way for organizations to communicate to the outside world. Communicate clearly and you shall be understood. P159/160

Imagine you go to a dinner party and somebody comes up to you and says, "You know what you need in your organization? 
M&M's. If you're not using M&M's in your business, you're leaving money on the table.  Somebody else comes up to you and says, "You know what you need? Oat milk. The data shows that all the people are buying oat milk these days. You should be selling oat milk in this economy." While you're standing over the punch bowl, yet another person offers some sage advice. "Oreo cookies," he says. "We made millions from implementing Oreo cookies in our organization.
You've got to do it."
Still somebody else comes up to you and says, "Celery. You've
got to get into celery."
You get all this great advice from all these highly accomplished people. Some of them are in the same industry. Some of them are more successful than you. Some of them have offered similar advice to others with great success. Now, what do you do?
You go to the supermarket and you buy celery, oat milk, Oreos and M&M's. You spend a lot of time at the supermarket walking the aisles. You spend a lot of money because you buy everything.
You may or may not get any value from some or all of these prod-ucts; there are no guarantees. Worse, if you're budget-constrained, you had to whittle down your choices again. And then which do you choose?
One thing's for sure: when you're standing in line at the supermarket with all of these items in your arms, your celery, oat milk, Oreos and M&Ms, nobody can see what you believe. What you do is supposed to serve as the tangible proof of what you believe, and you bought everything.
But what if you knew your WHY before you went to the super-market? What if your WHY is to do only things that are healthy?
To always do the things that are good for your body? You'll get all the same good advice from all the same people; the only difference is, the next time you go to the supermarket, you'll buy only oat milk and celery. Those are the only products that make sense.
It's not that the other advice isn't good advice, it's just not good for you. The advice doesn't fit. If you filter your decisions through your WHY, you spend less time at the supermarket and you spend less money, so there's an efficiency advantage also. You're guaranteed to get value out of all the products you bought. And, most importantly, when you're standing in line with your products in your arms, everybody can see what you believe. With only celery and oat milk it's obvious to people walking by what you believe. "I can see that you believe in looking after your health," they may say to you. "I feel the same way. I have a question for you." Congratulations. You just attracted a customer, an employee, a partner or a referral simply by making the right decisions. Simply ensuring that WHAT you do proves what you believe makes it easy for those who believe what you believe to find you. You have successfully communicated your WHY based on WHAT you do. P167/168/169

But here's the best part. As soon as I told you the WHY, you knew that we were going to buy only celery and oat milk even before you read it. As soon as I gave you the filter, as soon as I said the WHY, you knew exactly what decisions to make before said so.
That's called scale.
With a WHY clearly stated in an organization, anyone within the organization can make a decision as clearly and as accurately as the founder. A WHY provides the clear filter for decision-making.
Any decisions—hiring, partnerships, strategies and tactics—should all pass the Celery Test. P170

Achievement vs. Success
There is an irony to success. Many people achieve great things but still don't feel successful. That's because success and achievement are not the same thing, even though we often mistake one for the other. Achievement is something you reach or attain, like a goal.
It is something tangible, clearly defined and measurable. Success, in contrast, is a feeling or a state of being. "She feels successful.
She is successful," we say, using the verb to be to suggest this state of being. While we can easily lay down a path to reach a goal, laying down a path to reach that intangible feeling of success is more elusive. In my vernacular, achievement comes when you pursue and attain WHAT you want. Success comes when you are clear in pursuit of WHY you want it. The former is motivated by tangible factors while the latter by something deeper in the brain, where we lack the capacity to put those feelings into words.
Success comes when we wake up every day in that never-ending pursuit of WHY we do WHAT we do. Our achievements, WHAT we do, serve as the milestones to indicate we are on the right path. It is not an either/or—we need both. A wise man once said, "Money can't buy happiness, but it pays for the yacht to pull alongside it." There is great truth in this statement. The yacht represents achievement; it is easily seen and, with the right plan, completely attainable. The thing we pull alongside represents that hard-to-define feeling of success. Obviously, this is much harder to see and attain. Achievement and success are distinct concepts, and sometimes they go together and sometimes they don't. More importantly, some people, while in pursuit of success, simply mistake WHAT they achieve as the final destination. This is the reason they never feel satisfied no matter how big their yacht is, no matter how much they achieve. The false assumption we often make is that if we simply achieve more, the feeling of success will follow.
But it rarely does.
In the course of building a business or a career, we become more confident in WHAT we do. We become greater experts in HOW to do it. With each achievement, the tangible measurements of success and the feeling of progress increase. Life is good. How-ever, for most of us, somewhere in the journey we forget WHY we set out in the first place. This is true for individuals and organizations alike. What many entrepreneurs experience as individuals is the same transition that Walmart and other big companies either have gone through or are going through. And the greater the scale of the operation, the greater the impact of a fuzzy WHY.
Employees, customers and the community will all feel it.
Those with an ability to never lose sight of WHY, no matter how little or how much they achieve, can inspire us. Those with the ability to never lose sight of WHY and also achieve the milestones that keep everyone focused in the right direction are the great leaders. For great leaders, The Golden Circle is in balance.
They are in pursuit of WHY, they hold themselves accountable to
HOW they do it and WHAT they do serves as the tangible proof of what they believe. But most of us, unfortunately, reach a place where WHAT we are doing and WHY we are doing it eventually fall out of balance. We get to a point when WHY and WHAT are not aligned. It is the separation of the tangible and the intangible that marks the split. P179/180

The single greatest challenge any organization will face is... suc-cess. When the company is small, the founder will rely on their gut to make all the major decisions. From marketing to product, from strategy to tactics, hiring and firing, the decisions the founder makes will feel right. But as the organization grows, as it becomes more successful, it becomes physically impossible for one person to make every major decision. Not only must others be trusted and relied upon to make big decisions, but those people will also start making hiring choices. And slowly but surely, as the megaphone grows, the clarity of WHY starts to dilute.
Whereas gut was the filter for early decisions, rational cases and empirical data often serve as the sole basis for later decisions.
Organizations that go through the split are no longer inspired by a cause greater than themselves. They simply come to work, manage systems and try to reach certain preset goals. There is no longer a cathedral to build. The passion is gone and inspiration is al a minimum. At that point, for most who show up every day, what they do is just a job (if this is how the people on the inside feel, imagine how they think about or treat the people outside the company). It is no wonder that manipulations start to domInate not only how the company sells its wares but even how they retain employees. Bonuses, promotions and other enticements, even instilling fear in people, become the only way to hold on to talent. That's hardly inspiring. P183/184

Money is a perfectly legitimate measurement of goods sold or services rendered. But it is no calculation of value. Just because somebody makes a lot of money does not necessarily mean that they provide a lot of value. Likewise, just because somebody makes a little money does not necessarily mean they provide only a little value. Simply measuring the number of goods sold or the money brought in is no indication of value. Value is a feeling, not a calcu-lation. It is perception. One could argue that a product with more bells and whistles that sells for less is the greater value. But by whose standard? P190/191

A strong brand, like all other intangible factors that contribute to the perception of value, starts with a clear sense of WHY. If those outside the megaphone share your WHY and if you are able to clearly communicate that belief in everything you say and do, trust emerges and value is perceived. When that happens, loyal buyers will always rationalize the premium they pay or the inconvenience they suffer to get that feeling. To them, the sacrifice of time or money is worth it. They will try to explain that their feeling of value comes from quality or features or some other easy-to-point-to element, but it doesn't. Those are external factors and the feeling they get comes completely from inside them. When people can point to a company and clearly articulate what the company believes and use words unrelated to price, quality, service and features, that is proof the company has successfully navigated the split (or hasn't faced one yet). When people describe the value they perceive with visceral, excited words like "love," that is a sure sign that a clear sense of WHY exists. P191/192

When Gates founded Microsoft with Paul Allen in 1975, he did so to advance a higher cause: if you give people the right tools, and make them more productive, then everyone, no matter their lot in life, will have an opportunity to achieve their real potential.
"A PC in every home and on every desk," he envisioned; remarkable from a company that didn't even make PCs. He saw the PC as the great equalizer. Microsoft's most successful software, Windows, allowed anyone to have access to powerful technology. P192

Eight years and two CEOs later, the company was dangerously overextended just as it was facing an onslaught of competition from McDonald's, Dunkin' Donuts and other unexpected places. In a now-famous memo that Schultz wrote to his successor, Jim Donald, just months before returning to take the helm, he implored Donald to "make the changes necessary to evoke the heritage, the tradition and the passion that we all have for the true Starbucks experience." The reason the company was floundering was not that it grew too fast but that Schultz had not properly infused his WHY into the organization so that the organization could manage the WHY without him. In early 2008, Schultz replaced Donald with a leader who could better steer the company back to a time before the split: himself. Schultz retired in 2018 only to return again in 2022 as interim CEO to, once again, help right the ship. P198

A company with a purpose-to give the individual the power to stand up to established power. To empower the dreamers and the idealists to challenge the status quo and succeed. But their cause, their WHY, started long before Apple was born. P210

Apple's ability to do what they did had nothing to do with industry expertise. All computer and technology companies had open access to talent and resources and were just as qualified to produce all the products Apple made. It had to do with a purpose, cause or belief that started many years earlier with a couple of idealists in Cupertino, California. "I want to put a ding in the universe," Steve Jobs had said. And that's exactly what Apple did in the industries in which it competed. Apple was born out of its founders' WHY. There was no difference between one or the other. Apple was just one of the WHATs to Jobs's WHY. The personalities of Jobs and Apple were exactly the same. P211/212

The WHY does not come from looking ahead at what you want to achieve and figuring out an appropriate strategy to get there. It is not born out of any market research. It does not come from extensive interviews with customers or even employees. It comes from looking in the complete opposite direction from where you are now. Finding WHY is a process of discovery, not invention.
Just as Apple's WHY developed during the rebellious 1960s and
'70s, the WHY for every other individual or organization comes from the past. It is born out of the upbringing and life experience of an individual or small group. Every single person, has a WHY and every single organization has one too. An organiza-tion, don't forget, is one of the WHATs, one of the tangible things a founder or group of founders has done in their lives to prove their WHY. P214

Gaining clarity of WHY, ironically, is not the hard part. The hard part is the discipline to trust one's gut, to stay true to one's purpose, cause or be-liefs. Remaining completely in balance and authentic is the most difficult part. The few who are able to build a megaphone, and not just a company, around their cause are the ones who earn the ability to inspire. In doing so, they harness a power to move people that few can even imagine. Learning the WHY of a company or an organization, or understanding the WHY of any social move-ment, always starts with one thing: you. P215

When you compete against everyone else, no one wants to help you. But when you compete against yourself, everyone wants to help you. P222

We're always competing against someone else. We're always trying to be better than someone else. Better quality. More features. Better service. We're always comparing ourselves to others. And no one wants to help us. What if we showed up to work every day simply to be better than our-selves? What if the goal was to do better work this week than we did the week before? To make this month better than last month?
For no other reason than because we want to leave the organization in a better state than we found it?
All organizations start with WHY, but only the great ones keep their WHY clear year after year. Those who forget WHY they were founded show up to the race every day to outdo someone else instead of to outdo themselves. The pursuit, for those who lose sight of WHY they are running the race, is to win the medal or to beat someone else. P223
