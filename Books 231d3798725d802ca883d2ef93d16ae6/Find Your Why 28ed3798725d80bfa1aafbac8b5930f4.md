Happiness comes from what we do. Fulfilment comes from why we do it. P7

"Hold on," you might say. "Let's be honest here--aren't most people working to earn money? That's the obvious
"why." First, money is a result. Though it is a part of the picture, it's not what inspires any one of us to get out of bed in the morning. And for the cynics out there who think they or others really do get out of bed for the money, the question we ask is, what is the reason they want the money. Is it for freedom? To travel? To provide a lifestyle for their kids that they didn't have? Is it to keep score and show they have done more than others? The point is. money isn't the thing that drives people. WHY goes much deeper to understanding what motivates and inspires us.
It is the purpose, cause or belief that drives every organization and every person's individual career. Why does your company exist? Why did you get out of bed this morning? And why should anyone care? P13

We sell paper. We offer the highest quality product at the best possible price. Lower than any of our competitors. Wanna buy some?
This is a very rational pitch. It states clearly what the company does and attempts to persuade potential buyers to choose its product over others' on the basis of features and benefits. Though this approach may work now and then, at best it will result in a few recurring transactions. As soon as the buyer finds a better deal, they will be gone, because the pitch doesn't differentiate this specific vendor from other companies in any way that truly matters. Loyalty is not built on features and benefits. Features and benefits do not inspire. Loyalty and long-lasting relationships are based on something deeper. 

Let's try the pitch again. Let's start with WHY:
What good is an idea if it can't be shared? Our company was founded to help spread ideas. The more ideas that are shared, the greater the likelihood those ideas will have an impact in the world. There are many ways to share ideas; one is the written word. That's where we come in. We make paper for those words. We make paper for big ideas. Wanna buy some? P14

The outer section of the Golden Circle-the WHAT-corresponds to the outer section of the brain—the neocor tex. This is the part of the brain responsible for rational and analytical thought. It helps us understand facts and figures, features and benefits. The neocortex is also responsible for language.
The middle two sections of the Golden Circle-the WHY and HOW-correspond to the middle section of the brain, the limbic system. This is the part of the brain responsible for all our behavior and decision making. It's also responsible for all our feelings, like trust and loyalty. But unlike the neocortex, the limbic system has no capacity for lan-guage. This is where "gut feelings" come from. It's not our stomach. It's a feeling we get about a decision we have to make that we struggle to explain. P17

The WHY exists on a macro level and a micro level. A com pany has a WHY, each division or team has a WHY and every individual has a WHY. The opportunity is to make sure the right people are working in the right places in the right company. P24

If you're an entrepreneur, discover your WHY so you can communicate what is singular about your company to your employees and clients or customers. For exam-ple, Apple may not always sell the very best products-ahem, battery life-but if you're someone who wants to
"Think Different," you probably swear by Apple on an emotional level you'd never experience with, say, Dell.
And knowing your WHY makes it easier to hire the right people. Every entrepreneur wants a staff of true believers, but how can you find those people if you arent clear on what, beyond hard work, you need them to be lieve in? If you know your WHY, you can hire people who believe what you believe, which is a much stronger motivator than money. Knowing your WHY is the secret to hiring for "fit.” P28/29

• If you want to discover the WHY of the entire organization it will come from one of two sources: The first is from the founder's WHY, which draws from the origin story. If the founder is no longer available, we have a method that engages people in the organization to identity the WHY based on the best elements of the existing culture. P29

STEP 1: GATHER STORIES ANS SHARE THEM

At ts core the WHY is an origin story. By looking to our past and teasing out the most significant threads—-the ex periences we've had, the people we've been influenced by, the lives we've touched and the highs and lows we've facel—we can identify patterns. For individuals, our WHY is fully formed by our late teens. To uncover our WHY we must bring together our standout memories-our defining moments-and examine them to find the connections. For tribes, the WHY also comes from the past-either the origin story of how the company was unded or from specific stories shared by other members of the tribe that represent what makes them proud to be a part of the tribe. Either way, discovering your WHY is like panning for gold in the river of the past: the gold is there.
Jost in the debris of the river, hidden by rushing water Only when you take the time to pan for the significant moments of the past, retrieving them nugget by nugget, will they turn into treasure. P31

The more specific the memories, the better. "Our family book a driving vacation every summer"— nope, that's too general to be helpful. "Our family ahways took driving va-cations. One year the car broke down in the desert, and we had to hitchhike to Albuquerque. I was seriously scared but I remember thinking that I needed to be strong so that my younger sister wouldn't be scared as well, so 1 made up a game to entertain us"—this is the kind of specific detail you'll need! Rediscovering the details, the feelings, the conversations, the lessons learned will offer clues to who you are and what your WHY is. The more stories you can recover and share, the more data you'll compile. And the more data you can draw on, the more easily you'll begin to see the recurring ideas or themes. P31/33

You'll come up with as many specific, impactful memories as you can—at least ten. Once you've got them all down, you'll choose about five or six that made the biggest difference in your life and share them in as much detail as you can. P33

STEP 2: IDENTIFY THEMES

As you pan for your stories and share them, themes will start to emerge, insights about yourself or your team that you may never have expressed before. As the process unfolds, one or two of those nuggets will seem to shine brighter than all the others.
They will feel bigger, more important. They will shine so brightly that you'll point to them and say, "That's me-that's who I am," or "That's us—that's our team." These themes become the foundation of your Why Statement. P34

STEP 4: DRAFT AND REFINE A WHY STATEMENT

With one or two shiny nuggets in hand, you're ready to take a crack at your Why Statement. Try to make yours:

- simple and clear
- actionable
- focused on the effect you'll have on others, and
- expressed in affirmative language that resonates with you.

Eventually, you will put your Why Statement into this format:

TO__________ SO THAT_________.

P35

The first blank represents the contribution you make to the lives of others. The second blank represents the impact of your contribution. So could your Why Statement be, "To finish every project ahead of schedule and under budget, so that I can be pro-anted and earn enough to save college money for my kids? No. Even if you see that as the truth right now, your Why Statement will go deeper than that. It is everlasting and must be relevant in both your personal and professional life. It is a statement of your value at work as much as it is the reason your friends love you. We don't have a professional WHY and personal WHY. We are who we are wherever we are. Your contribution is not a product or a service. It's the thing around which everything you do the decisions you make, the tasks you perform. the products you sell-aligns to bring about the impact you envision. P35/36

Here's how Simon Sinek expresses his WHY: **To** inspire people to do the things that inspire them **so that**, together, we can change our world. The impact Simon seeks is for each of us to change our world, in big and small ways, for the better. Fantastic! But this goal is too broad and abstract on its own. It's his contribu-tion, what he actually does on Monday morning to make change happen, that gives direction to his desired impact.
The contribution part-to inspire others—gives Simon the focus he needs. The books he writes, the talks he gives, the workshops he conducts are WHAT he does-all of them infused with his cause—to inspire people. And the more effectively he inspires others, the more likely every person who is drawn to his work will make a change to our world for the better. P36/37

FIND YOUR WHY

river of your past, recalling stories of your life and career from which your significant themes can emerge. Only you can retrieve those stories from your memory, but when it comes to interpreting them, a second set of eyes and ears—a partner—is invaluable. Listening to your sto-ries, your partner can offer a perspective that is nearly impossible to see for yourself. Finding the right partner is an important part of the process. That doesn't mean you must find a trained psychologist or coach, just someone who genuinely wants to help you find your WHY. The partner is there to help identify the golden thread, the recurring themes and ideas that are the basis for your WHY. P41

At its core, the WHY is an origin story. Who we are is the sum total of all the experiences we've had growing up-the lessons we learned, the teachers we had and the things we did. In order to help your companion discover their WHY, you'll need to listen to stories from their past. Their WHY represents who they are at their natural best and will be revealed through specific stories and experiences that affected their life and shaped who they are. P44

YOUR ROLE
Your main role is to listen to the stories then ask thoughtful questions that will help them dig deeper to find the underlying meaning of each memory. As you listen, you'll take notes, identifying themes, ideas, words or phrases that recur in the stories; these themes will weave together into a golden thread to define who they are at their natural best. P44

HOW TO BE AN ACTIVE LISTENER

Active listening is about hearing more than the words that are said It's about understanding the meaning, motivation or emotion behind those words. Some of the techniques of active listening are sim-ple: Make eye contact; acknowledge verbally and nonverbally what the other person says (e.g., offer affirmation like, "go on," or nod your head as you understand things); invite them to say more about what happened or how they feel about it. Pay particular attention to nonverbal cues. Facial expressions, body language and even long pauses all serve as clues as to how the story makes them feel. The stories you will hear are some of the most meaningful of their life, and they may evoke strong feelings. Pride, love, fulfillment, fear, be-longing, loneliness-all these and more might show up in different ways. Some people get more animated-use their hands more, sit on the edge of their seats, raise their voices-others may get choked up or become soft-spoken and reflective. P45

We often find that people begin their stories with straightforward facts-what happened, when it happened and who was there. It's what we naturally do when we tell stories. While these details are important to set context to what will be shared next, they won't help you get to the WHY, because the WHY is connected to feelings.
Sharing feelings is a very important part of the process. The goal is to help them express the feelings and emotions they felt at the time. It's really hard to connect with a feeling when we speak in generalities. We can't stress enough that the stories your companion shares need to be very specific. P46

Remember, the WHY is not who we aspire to be, it's who we truly are. The stories are tangible proof of who they truly are. It's your job to ask follow-up questions until you uncover the reason this specific story is significant. 

- How did that make you feel?
- What is it about this experience that you absolutely loved?
- You've probably felt this same feeling before. What is it about this story that makes it special? (Eg, if they say they "felt proud," you can ask them what about this pride was different from other times they felt it.)
- How did this experience affect you and who you've become?
- What was the lesson from that experience that you still carry with you today?
- Of all the stories you could have shared with me, what makes this specific one so special that you chose to tell it?
- If someone else features prominently in the story, ask them how that person made a difference in their lives or what they love or admire about that person. P47/48

The better you capture the themes of how they felt, the easier it will be to put together the Why Statement that feels really authentic to them. P49

In addition to the recurring themes that you'll listen for in each story, there are two other main components to look for: contribution and impact. These are the building blocks of the final Why Statement-the contribution the person makes to the lives of others and the impact of that contribution over time. We write it in this format:

TO__{contribution}__ SO THAT__{impact}__.

The contribution is the first blank and the impact is the second blank.

For example, Simon Sinek, the author of Start with Why, expresses his own WHY in these words: To inspire people to do the things that inspire them so that, together, we can change our world. Simon's contribution is what he actively does for others (seeking to inspire them) and the impact is what happens when that contribution is made (a lot of people working together to change our world).
With that in mind, do what you can to find out what your companion is giving someone else or receiving in each story (the contribu-tion) and what difference it may have made to them or others the impact). You'll begin to see a pattern that will help you understand the contribution and impact of their WHY. There is almost always some sort of emotional cue, verbal or nonverbal, when they touch on one or both of these themes. P49/50

• Avoid questions that start with "why." This may sound coun terintuitive, since you are doing a Why Discovery. But there's a problem with questions that start with "why." Ironically, they are actually harder to answer. "Why does that story matter to you?" for example, triggers the part of our brain that is not responsible for language. It's easier to answer a question that starts with "what." For example, "What is it about that story that really matters to you?" It's basically the same question but framed in a way that is easier for someone to answer. It answers the "why" question by allowing the person to talk more specifically about the components of the story that were meaningful. P51/52

There are three steps to discovering your WHY (tell stories, identify themes, draft the Why statement. P54/55

</aside>

The goal of the story-gathering exercise is to end up with at least five stories that you consider the most impactful of your life. The more stories you have, the easier it will be for your partner to detect the patterns and themes that will lead to your WHY. Remember that each story must be about a specific time, place or moment. The more specific you are, the more you'll feel an emotional connection to that memory. And it's this emotional connection that will lead to your WHY. P58

With your themes all in one place, take a couple of moments to look them over. In some cases, the theme will be in every story. However, your partner should be able to tie each theme back to at least two of the stories you told. Re-member, an idea becomes a theme because it reoccurs in at least two seemingly unconnected stories. P72

Ironically, asking a question that starts with "why" doesn't actually get us to the WHY. That's because the question
"why" is an emotional question, and it tends to elicit vague or reactive answers. In contrast, asking a "what" question elicits a more thoughtful and exact answer. Now ask the same question again, this time framed with "what": "What is it about me that made you choose to be friends with me?" This time your buddy may say something like, "I don't know. I care about you. I can trust you. We're into the same stuff. And we just get along really well!" That's a logical answer, but of course, those are the basic elements of almost any friendship. Continue to play the devil's ad-vocate, always framing your "why" questions with "what." For example, if you want to ask "why...," instead ask "what is it about..." Follow up with something like, "Great, you've just defined what it means to be a friend! But what is it about me in particular?" P77

Let's take it a step further. Our whole team shares that Nested WHY. However, we are also individuals in that nest. Each of us makes our own unique contribution to our collective WHY. So within the team, each of us has an individual WHY that's all our own. P88
