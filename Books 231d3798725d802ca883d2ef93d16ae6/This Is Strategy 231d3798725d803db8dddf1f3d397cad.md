To find a better strategy, we need to be prepared to walk away from the one we've defaulted into.

A strategy isn’t a map – it’s a compass. Strategy is a better plan. 

WHAT DO PEOPLE WANT?
Once our basic needs for food, shelter and health are met, most people dance with three conflicting desires:

- Affiliation
- Status
- Freedom from fear

(We can probably add joy, wonder, thrills, satisfaction and other in-

ternal narratives, but for now let's focus on these three.)

Affiliation is community. Fitting in. Being liked. Affiliation is wearing the right fashion, using the correct salad fork and knowing the words to the song around the campfire.

Status is always relative. Who eats lunch first? Who's up and who's

down?

And freedom from fear is an internal construct. Fear can be used as

fuel, but it's more likely to be avoided.

Marketing works on these three principles. And systems all use them

to maintain their structure.

If you want to understand why someone makes a choice, look for what people actually want, not only the proxies and substitutes they say they want.

Elegance is simplicity, efficiency, and effectiveness.

culture is the driver of most systems, and culture is the result of the interactions between and among people. Strategies stumble when they depend on someone with power dictating how things will occur.

If you want to grow a garden, you'll need to plant seeds, but it's the ecosystem and the climate that will determine what happens after that.

Strategy is the hard work of choosing what to do today to improve our tomorrow. 

A series of 17 questions shines a light on the work to be done. It brings tomorrow forward to today, right here and right now, allowing us to articulate a strategy.

- Who are we here to serve?
- What is the change we seek to make?
- What are our resources?
- What is the genre we're working in?
- Who has done something like this before me?
- What systems are in play?
- Am I changing someone's status?
- Why would anyone voluntarily choose to be part of this work?
- What will they tell their colleagues?
- Who gains in status, affiliation and power by supporting this work?
- Will early support translate into more support later?
- Where is the network effect?
- What do I need to learn to make this work?
- Who do I need to work with?
- Where is the dip and when should I quit?
- What will I do if it doesn't work out?
- How much is enough?

If you listen to the original recordings of rock stars like Sly Stone, Janis Joplin and Lou Reed, you'll hear that they started out doing their best to sound exactly like everyone else.
That's what the system seems to reward. That's what gets you a producer and a demo and apparently, a shot at stardom. Except it almost never works. The big step between musician and rock star is the decision to sound like yourself instead of seeking to sound like everyone else.

AVOIDING HINDSIGHT BIAS
Most business theories fall into an easy trap: They find a few successful examples and then explain how their theory explains their success.
Of course, they aren't clear how their theory doesn't apply to all the
similar businesses that failed.
The reliance on hindsight bias often leads individuals to mistakenly believe they possessed advance knowledge of an event's outcome, falsely convincing themselves that they could predict the event without empirical evidence, merely through logical deduction.
In truth we still don't know. We don't know why Facebook succeeded and Friendster failed. Why General Magic struggled but Airbb made it to the other side.
Anyone who promises a detailed road map is unaware of how com-
plex creating the future is.
All we can do is look for the right conditions, not expect a guarantee.

The first group are early adopters, not adapters. They're eager. They're looking for something new. Their role in the system is to bring inno-vation, and they gain status and satisfaction by looking for something better.
This is less than 3% of the population. That means that when you bring something new to the world, 97% of the folks you interact with will not embrace it.
The folks at the far end of the curve are adapters. They fight change.
It's a threat to them. Adapters have plenty of objections, but what they're really saying is, "I'm afraid."
Anthony lannarino teaches that that the job of a sales team isn't to persuade people to buy from us. It's to find the people who WANT to try 

something new, and to politely and eagerly send everyone else on their way.
The job of the marketer is to make something so remarkable that this tiny group of adopters can't stop telling their peers. They're the ones that get the word out, not you. This phenomenon has been clear for decades, and yet people keep looking for a shortcut.
A shortcut to change the entire system.
A shortcut to promote an idea to every human and explain why the
new way is better.
A shortcut to get picked.
Your idea might be rejected because it's not better. But it's probably going
to be rejected because it's new.

Author adrienne maree brown encourages us to move at the speed of trust. Critical connections are more important than critical mass. The next step isn't to host a huge rally. It's to create the conditions for just enough people to come back again and again and again, forming the nucleus for real change.

Paying it back is trading favors. Reciprocity is a natural human instinct, amplified by culture. If someone does a nice thing for you, you are inclined to do a nice thing in return.
Paying it forward means offering something to someone who can do nothing in return for you.

SCALE AND MAGIC
The smallest organizations have an advantage when they create projects.
With nothing to lose and few people to please, it's possible to create moments of magic. Small projects from small teams can leap forward with the confidence of knowing that they don't have far to fall.
When a project works, it's tempting and generous to scale it. Offer it to more people. Turn one successful restaurant into a chain, or a small medical practice into a much larger one.
And almost inevitably, it falters.
The only way to effectively scale magic is to create a strategy where
the scale is the magic.
Heinz ketchup is better because it's the regular kind, the safe kind, the normal kind. That's the magic they offer. Disney is magic because it offers predictable, industrialized, mass fun. They turned that from an oxymoron to a motto. It's the place to go if you want to go to where everyone else is going.
Projects where the scale is the magic have a network effect. The more
people who use them, the better they get.

BRINGING STRATEGY TO MARKETING

There are three steps:

- Tell a story, a true story, one that holds up. And tell it only to your smallest viable audience, the tiny group that is actually listening to you, that cares and that is among the early adopters. Create tension and urgency.
- Give this group a reason to share the story with others. Something that will increase their status, their affiliation with others, or increase the utility of supporting your product, service or cause.

Give them the scaffolding to do this.

- Help them, through use or narrative, alter the story to make it theirs.

This means that strategic marketing begins by seeing the path, the way the idea spreads over time and through the community.

It requires a specific story, not simply, "You can pick anyone and we're anyone." Instead, we seek to be of service to a small group, people who would miss us if we didn't exist.

Once this group finds affiliation and status from engaging with our work, we create the conditions for them to share the story with others— but they won't tell the story that attracted them in the first place. They'l tell a different story, also true, and one that will attract their friends.

Luxury isn't more utility—it's intentional waste: Luxury goods are items that are worth more (to some) because they cost more.
The cost itself is the benefit that is being sold.
There used to be a correlation between superior performance and price. In 1900, a Hermès saddle or a Louis Vuitton trunk was arguably better built for the work it was put to.
Today, though, a more expensive resort, bottle of wine, or article of clothing is likely not the item of highest performance. It is simply a symbol that the purchaser is happy to understand and perhaps show off. Poor performance might even be part of the value proposition. Not only can you afford to pay extra, but you can afford to pay extra and have your feet hurt as well.
Money is a story, and price is a way of telling that story.

> How did Dorothy persuade the Lion, Tin Man, and Scarecrow to join her on the trip to see the Wizard? Did she make a case about how much she missed home? The lesson here is worth remembering. **She created the conditions so that the others would get what they wanted by joining her**. They got to move closer to their stated goals of courage, compassion, and smarts. But more than that, she offered them status and affiliation. The Wizard was simply a stepping-stone on the way to where they were hoping to go.

Require effort and expense from the early adopters: When working with the pioneers, require effort and offer status. It's not convenient, easy, or free to go first-there's no tension in that.
Embrace the effort. The appearance of risk is actually a benefit for this cohort.

**The fear of missing the new thing**: Early adopters seek novelty. If you create an innovation, you've built an attractor for people who seek inno-vation.

**The fear of being left behind**: When a system begins to adopt a new idea, particularly one that amplifies a head start, others will follow because they can feel the tension that comes with waiting.

**The fear of being left out:** This isn't quite the same as being left behind.
This is the "everyone else is already doing this" tension of group dynamics.

**The generosity of the network effect**: When a colleague or friend asks you to join as a favor to them, there's tension about not granting this request.

**The fear of being seen as a fraud:** Surprisingly common, rarely talked about, it usually helps us avoid shortcuts and hustles, but it also holds us back from embracing bravery.

**What will I tell my boss?** Even nodes that aren't eager to explore new frontiers are aware that their organization might want them to do so.

**And there are more:**
The fear of failing, and its surprising cousin, the fear of succeeding.
The fear of responsibility.
The fear of speaking out or speaking up.
The fear of being judged.
The fear of being out of sync.
The fear of the new or the unfamiliar.
The fear of strangers.
The fear of insufficiency.
The fear of the end.
And the reason it's so difficult to talk about this: the fear of fear.

It became the bestselling luxury car in California for this reason. The early adopters adopted, and then plenty of luxury car buyers followed, because they didn't want to fall behind or look like technophobes.
It's worth noting that the number one thing that prompted conversations in parking lots (according to a Tesla insider) was the retracting door handles. People would walk over to a new Tesla and ask-not about the value of electric cars, or the shift they represented—about the cool door handles.

> Trust leads to trust. Influence creates influence. The network effect is the dynamic of our time, and most of us don't even notice it. The value of a network goes up exponentially as more people engage
with it. People don't engage with your network because it's good for you.
They do it because it's good for them. The network effect challenges system architects to create assets that provide value for users that increase when they invite their colleagues to join in.

Or consider Prada's baseball cap, a $650 hat that offers no functional advantages over a $4 alternative except that the social benefits of wearing one in some communities are large enough that for those purchasers, it's a bargain. There are countless substitutes, but none of them can offer precisely the same combination of status, affiliation, and belonging that this ridiculous item can offer to the right person.

THRASHING AT THE START
Steve McConnell shares the most important lesson about project man-agement: Changing course and exploring your options are far cheaper at the start than they are at the end.
While this is obvious, we almost always do it backward.
It's only toward the end that the boss takes a look, that the community review board gets involved, that we share our idea with the salesforce because it's at the end that things begin to feel real and imminent, and busy and important and distracted people have trouble paying attention when they have competing emergencies.
The discipline of project management is to insist, "We're not going to write a line of code until you sign off on the storyboards" or "We're not going to lay a brick until the plans are approved." Once your project launches, it quickly evolves as a result of interactions with the community, the shifts in your insights, and the surprising way time unfolds.
And so a new project begins. Thrash again. At the beginning. Repeat.

COMMUNICATION WITH INTENT
The larger the team, the more we need to lean into the process of communication. It begins by being clear about our roles, our purpose, the change we seek to make, and the people we're seeking to serve. More than that, we need to create the conditions for this honest project-focused communication to continually occur without heroic effort. This is how buildings get built and movies get made-when our project culture is obvious and the proxies for progress and quality are clear, the work gets done. Consider this for a moment: Professional projects have project man-agers. If it's important, we don't wing it, or hope for the best. Instead, we're thoughtful and intentional about how we talk with each other.
This isn't completed in one meeting. This is the ongoing commitment to creating and maintaining a flow of information over time. The world changes. We’re changing it. Without a resilient communications system, the project stalls. Projects require strategy, but our strategy is directly related to our
ability to ship the work.

PROBLEMS ARE OPPORTUNITIES

When a decision is called for, there must be a problem to solve. If there are no problems, there's no need for projects and no room for growth.

Russ Ackoff's writing about systems asserts that problems have five

components:

- A decision-maker
- Elements of the situation that are controllable by the decision-maker
- Elements which are out of the decision-makers control
- Constraints
- A range of possible outcomes

When all five are present, we get to do our work. The work of making a docision.

If they're not present, then we don't have a problem or a decision to make. We simply have a situation.

Celebrate the problems abead. Problems are opportunities to create the conditions for better outcomes.

The way forward is simple, but not easy.

First, we need to see the problem. We need to understand the sys-tems, the constraints, and the desires of those we serve. We can become smarter about what assets we control and how we can invest in them and make them work better for us.

Don't focus on a situation, which is not a problem at all. A situation is a mismatch of constraints and goals. A situation becomes a problem when we have the agency to change something and move forward Second, we can be honest about our objectives. Almost every inelegant or failed strategy begins with conflicting or muddied objectives.

Then, we can focus on the elements we control as we make decisions.

The ones we can't control must be understood, but it's pointless to try to change them. When in doubt, reexamine why you put these elements in the "can't control" category in the first place.

If the project is not working, find a new objective. Make better de-cisions. Build new assets. And avoid trying to control elements that can't possibly be changed.

Getting stung by a wasp is an unfortunate situation. It hurts. It can't be undone. Other than a bit of first aid, there are no decisions to be made.

Avoiding getting stung by a wasp tomorrow is a problem. We have choices to make, investments of time or effort to consider, and a chance to reconsider the objectives that may have caused the first situation.

BETTER DECISIONS AND BETTER OUTCOMES

If others are regularly outperforming your strategy, there could be four

reasons:

- They could have a systemic head start—this sort of luck doesn't even out over time. If the system compounds their initial advan-tage, it's going to take more than good decisions to overcome this.
- They could have an asset advantage this is a form of head start.
A small advantage in assets pays off, they buy more assets, and their lead continues. If the resources and network and skills they bring to bear are to their advantage, you'll need to find a way to find the scaffolding you'll need to replicate their performance.
- They could have access to better information. Decisions are based on what you know and how you see the world. If others are seeing more clearly than you do, you'll need to see what they see.
- They might be better at making decisions than you are. If all other things are equal, and others are getting better outcomes with the same information and assets, you benefit when you acknowledge that they're better at making decisions than you are-and then learn from what they do.
