There are three key mental shortcuts that help people decide between brands.

We call them Fame, Feeling and Fluency. To our fast-thinking, System 1 minds:

- If a brand comes readily to mind, it's a good choice (Fame).
- If a brand feels good, it's a good choice (Feeling).
- If a brand is recognisable, it's a good choice (Fluency). P17.

There is no simple recipe for creating fame, nor can it be done in a purely calculating and clinical way; it needs the energy, imagination, risk taking and shameless braggadocio that street entertainers and charlatans have relied on in all ages. P30

These are only a few points from a much longer and more complex story, but they may be enough to suggest some of the conditions that make fame possible.

TIl ouline these briefly now, but will return to them as we go on to develop them as a tentative template for how we could think about the creation of fame, whether for brands, celebrities, or anything else.

1. Some intrinsic qualities are needed which will be compelling or attractive enough for the celebrity to appeal to the public and, first of all, gain admittance to a platform from which the public can be appealed to.
2. But what is also needed is the ability to access audiences repeatedly and on a massive scale. It is very rare for this to happen automatically as a result of intrinsic talen some mechanism for achieving mass exposure must also be employed. In the case of the Beckhams, this abilicy to command mass exposure was initially contrived by their agents (Fuller and Spencer), access to events or contexts that already had mass audiences (che Brits, Virgin Records, Manchester United), and soon by themselves becoming a news story which media could not resist covering.
3. The oclebrity must be associared with enough unique and memorable images or other distinctive assets' to be immediarely recognisable and distinctive. Their distinctive assets, besides their faces, included nicknames and jokes (Posh and Becks, Beckingham Palace), hairstyles and outfits.
4. When the combination of intrinsic qualities, distinctive assets and mass exposure reach a certain critical point, social diffusion kicks in and multiplies the effects: this is driven both by the public and the media in a symbiotic relationship. Social diffusion is often powerfully enhanced by controversy or ambiguity, as press and public alike respond to events by trying to make sense of them or arguing abour them.
5. 

The management of fame therefore involves three territories beside the most obvious one of ensuring that the intrinsic appeal of the brand/ celebrity/ product is maintained. There must be a conscious strategy for reaching mass audiences (repeatedly); careful nurturing of distinctive assets; and the use of the many techniques which exist for enabling and encouraging social diffusion.

None of chis is very new. The formula describes Barnum's success with Jenny Lind (or indeed the Feejee Mermaid). Jenny Lind was, as the Times put ic, merely a talented vocalist. Her talent as a performer had already made her famous enough in Europe to attract Barnum's attention. But it was Barnum who created the platform for her to perform, and attracted the mass audiences who would become aware of her (by no means limited only to those wealthy enough to actually hear her perform), by providing news stories which the media of the day were keen ra present to their mass audiences. P84/85

What Holt calls cultural branding' has enough truth in it to sound plansible, things that want to stay famous need to be responsive to changing times, attitudes, and fashions, and occasionally they do something that so captures a popular mood or moment in time that it has a greater than usual impact. P100

My second difficulty with accepting cultural branding as a practical approach is thar i sems to me to substitute a different kind of essentialism for the brand bureaucracy Holt and Cameron so reject. Its much easier to post-rationalise the abstract meanings behind cultural phenomena than to start from abstract meanings and create something tangible. Of course, if you can make this approach work for you, that's great. But as Holt himself admits at the ourset, the process of'cultural branding has in reality always been a tacit and emergent one:

I've yet to find a cultural brand strategy articulated in formal documents like marketing plans, brand bibles, and creative briefs... cultural brand strategies have lurked primarily in the gut feel of ad agency creatives and other commercial artists. P101

Traditional advertising that only entertains doesnâ€™t work. P109

The principal effect of advertising for mature brands in mature categories is to defend brand share and price against the competition. P110

Brands with a higher share of voice than share of market tend to grow, while those spending less than their share of market tend to decline. P112

l's also true that our perception of what constitutes a great performance is massively influenced by fame itself. Because fame is a 'complex, adaptive, semi-chaotic system it grows and evolves through time, and one of the important feedback loops within it is the fact that we rate things more highly as they increase in fame and familiarity. Because we prefer what is familiar, because we choose what comes more easily to mind, and because we are more attracted to what we see valued by others, things tend to become more attractive to us as they become better known and more popular. In the words of Jeremy Bullmore that I quoted earlier,

...for most human beings, fame not only holds a powerful fascination but bestows an incalculable value on anything that enjoys it. We value the famous far more highly than the little known. P123

where it might lead us. What lessons could brands learn (or perhaps remind themselves of) from rudies of fame in the worlds of entertainment, fashion, and celebricy, such as Hit Makers or The Tipping Point? Because, despite the inescapable element of chance, if we understand which factors are generally necessary conditions for fame, we may least increase the odds in our favour.
Both Thompson's and Gladwell's inquiries separate the factors which enable fame into two groups. The first group includes all the intrinsic qualities of the performance itself which make it attractive and distinctive; the second group, the ways in which the performance becomes exposed to and is diffused among large populations. Both of these matter: both are usually necessary conditions for success. There are intrinsic qualities in a performance that significantly increase the chances of it becoming famous; but it will not become famous automatically as a result of these intrinsic qualities (except as a highly rare event).
In making this distinction, both authors draw explicit parallels with epidemiology.
The spread of a disease can also be analysed as a function of two different kinds of factors. The first group of factors are to do with the intrinsic nature of the infecting organism - the way it is transmitted, how easily it is transmitted, how long it remains infectious in the carrier, etc. The second group of factors are contextual - these include environmental factors (e.g. the prevalence of anopheles mosquitoes for malaria, an infected source of water for cholera), and many social patterns of human behaviour which may either enable or inhibit the transmission of the disease, such as hygiene, travel, sexual activity, and so on.
Gladwell sums up this analogy at the outset of his book:
..the idea is very simple. It is that the best way to understand the emergence of fashion trends, the ebb and flow of crime waves...the transformation of unknown books into bestsellers, or the rise of teenage smoking, or the phenomena of word of mouth, or any number of the other mysterious changes that mark everyday life is to think of them as epidemics. Ideas and products and messages and behaviours spread just like viruses do. (p. 7, emphasis added). P125

These three approaches have in recent years been labelled as paid for, earned and owned media. Perhaps the most reliable approach is to make use of all three, as the safest route to fame has always been to do as much as possible.
One of the core strategic principles of the British Armed Forces is called The Principle of Redundancy. The idea is that if you are fighting a war there is no point in trying to optimise efficiency - the only thing that matters is winning.
The more tanks, the more aircraft, the more drones, the more ammunition, the more field hospitals you have, the better your chances. Rather than ask 'how cheaply can we do this?, the question is 'how much can we possibly get and how much can we possibly deploy?. This idea runs completely counter to modern business's obsession with efficiency, yet it tends to characterise the major land-grabs of fame. A hundred years ago, Coca-Cola won territory in the soft drinks market it has held ever since by endlessly multiplying its mental and physical availability; in the present century, Amazon has won what currently looks like an unassailable position in online retailing by investing more than it makes every year into growing the business. Barnum did not launch Jenny Lind's tour by booking three concerts to 'see how it went' - he almost bankrupred himself in committing to 150, and as a result they all sold out. Excess and apparent wastage are not just important because they accelerate the gain of a dominant position. P129

If there is a choice to be made between efficiency and thinking big, you cannot afford to be efficient if you want to be famous.
So I believe mass communication events should be considered necessary in any strategy for creating fame. But they are not sufficient. We also need to consider what factors make content infectious. What are the qualities that make something enjoyable or interesting enough for people to spend time with it, remember it, value it, and share it with others? And what kind of processes and cultures are more likely to produce such content? P130

I think the concept of distinctive assets can be applied to any kind of fame.
Celebrities each have a ready-made distinctive asset in their own face, though many add importantly to this with other aspects of personal styling - Bill Haley's kiss curl, Elviss quiff, Freddy Mercury's moustache, even Donald Trump's lurid comb over. Geri Halliwell's Union Jack dress, Charlie Chaplin's bowler hat and cane, James Dean's overcoat all have aspects of distinctive assets, and so of course do personal catchphrases and individual accents: if I mention a red fez and the words 'Just Like That!' spoken in a northern accent, most British readers will know who I mean. But because examples are so universally easy to find, in this chapter I shall focus on distinctive assets used by brands, and especially in advertising. P144

widespread and lasting fame, whether for entertainers, celebrities, or commercial brands, almost invariably depends on meeting four conditions.

- First, whatever is offered must be sufficiently interesting or appealing to people;
- Secondly, it must find ways to reach mass audiences;
- Thirdly it must be distinctive, unique and memorable and it helps a lot if it's legally ownable too);
- Fourthly, the public and the media themselves must engage with it actively (and they can be encouraged though not compelled to do so).

These propositions may sound obvious, even banal. But let's consider also what they leave out as relatively unimportant. Fame does not, for instance, automatically reward the best product or performer - unless they can fulfil these other conditions, they won't be famous. P163

So why, in that case, does the advertising industry today so often seem to ignore these simple principles - even to consciously avoid them? With a dwindling number of honourable exceptions, it seems to me that professional practice in the twenty-first century is dominated by the following characteristics:
â€¢ An obsession with targeting and efficiency, and too much wishful thinking about the power of virality, both routinely eclipse any ambition to achieve mass coverage.
Far too much of what is produced by ad agencies not only lacks any popular appeal, but seems proud of the fact that it has avoided it. Popular' is almost a term of abuse.

- The use of distinctive assets, as was shown earlier, has declined almost to the point of extinction - just at the moment when we seem to have a better scientific basis for understanding why they matter so much.
- And in the absence of these first three conditions, it is not surprising if most brands form a very small part of today's public conversations. P164

Creativity is, after all, about breaking something down and putting something new in its place. (emphasis added)

Paul Arden, the late creative director and author of a best-selling little book called It's Not How Good You Are, It's How Good You Want To Be, wrote,
All creative people need something to rebel against.

Yet every example I have given earlier in this book - such as Barclaycard, 'Hilltop, or the Honey Monster - suggests that all this is, at best, one small strand in the process of creating something that appeals to the public or has any lasting value. Familiarity is as important as originality; craft is much more important than destruction; playfulness, collaboration, and patience (however painful) are normally much more productive than anger and machismo. It's not just about blowing shit up. P180
