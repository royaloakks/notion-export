A tribe is a group of people connected to one another, connected to a leader, and connected to an idea. For millions of years, human beings have been part of one tribe or another. A group needs only two things to be a tribe: a shared interest and a way to communicate. P1

Forty years ago, Jerry Garcia and the Grateful Dead made some decisions that changed the music industry forever. You might not be in the music business and you may never have been to a Dead concert, but the impact the Dead made affects almost every industry, including yours.
In addition to grossing more than $100 million during their career, the Dead helped us understand how tribes work.
They didn't succeed by selling records (they only had one Top 40 album). Instead, they succeeded by attracting and leading a tribe.
Human beings can't help it: we need to belong. One of the most powerful of our survival mechanisms is to be part of a tribe, to contribute to (and take from) a group of likeminded people. We are drawn to leaders and to their ideas, and we can't resist the rush of belonging and the thrill of the new.
When one Deadhead says to another, "2-14-70," it's like a secret code. The smiles and the hugs and handshakes define who we are-being in a tribe is a big part of how we see ourselves. We want to belong not to just one tribe, it turns out, but to many. And if you give us tooks and make it easy, we'll keep joining.
Tribes make our lives better. And leading a tribe is the best life of all. P2/3

the Internet eliminates geography.
This means that existing tribes are bigger, but more im-portant, it means that there are now more tribes, smaller tribes, influential tribes, horizontal and vertical tribes, and tribes that could never have existed before. Tribes you work with, tribes you travel with, tribes you buy with. Tribes that vote, that discuss, that fight. Tribes where everyone knows your name. The professionals at the CIA are a tribe and so are the volunteers at the ACLU. P4

Marketing used to be about advertising, and advertising is expensive. Today, marketing is about engaging with the tribe and delivering products and services with stories that spread
Today, the market doesn't want the same thing it wanted yesterday. Marketing, a hundred years of incessant marketing, has drilled into us a thirst for what's new. And new isn't so stable, is it? P13/14

It's worth taking a second is think about what it really means to be a tribe.
In Permission Marketing, years ago, I wrote about how marketers must earn the right to deliver anticipated , personal, and relevant messages to people who want to get them. And that's still correct, as far as it goes.
But tribes go much further. That's because in addition to the messages that go from the marketer or the leader to the tribe, there are the messages that go sideways, from member to member, and back to the leader as well.
The Grateful Dead understood this. They created concerts to allow people not just to hear their music, but to hear it together. That's where the tribe part comes in. P18

Great leaders create movements by empowering the tribe to communicate. They establish the foundation for people to make connections, as opposed to commanding people to follow them.
This is how Skype spread around the world. Cofounder Niklas Zennström understood that overthrowing the tyranny of the phone companies was too big a project for a small company. But if he could empower the tribe to do it them-selves, to connect to one another and to spread the word, he would be able to incite a movement.
Malcolm Gladwell wrote about the fall of the Berlin Wall, and it involved much the same dynamic. The collapse of East Germany wasn't the work of one hardworking activist. Instead, it was the gradual but inexorable growth of the tribe, a loosely coordinated movement of activists that gained in force until it couldn't be stopped.
One after another, intractable problems fall in the face of movements. P20

As we saw earlier, it takes only two things to turn a group of people into a tribe:

- A shared interest
- A way to communicate

The communication can be one of four kinds:

- Leader to tribe
- Tribe to leader
- Tribe member to tribe member
- Tribe member to outsider

So a leader can help increase the effectiveness of the tribe and its members by

- transforming the shared interest into a passionate goal and desire for change;
- providing tools to allow members to tighten their com-munications; and
- leveraging the tribe to allow it to grow and gain new members.

Most leaders focus only on the third tactic. A bigger tribe somehow equals a better tribe. In fact, the first two tactics almost always lead to more impact. Every action you take as a leader can affect these three elements, and the challenge is to figure out which one to maximize. P21

Anatomy of a Movement

Senator Bill Bradley defines a movement as having three el-

ements:

1. A narrative that tells a story about who we are and the future we're trying to build
2. A connection between and among the leader and the tribe
3. Something to do the fewer limits, the better

Too often organizations fail to do anything but the third. P23

In an article posted on his Technium Web site, Kevin Kelly brilliantly described the world of "1,000 True Fans." A true fan, he argues, is a member of the tribe who cares deeply about you and your work. That person will cross the street to buy from you or bring a friend to hear you or invest a little extra to support you.
An individual artist needs only a thousand true fans in her tribe. It's enough.
It's enough because a thousand fans will bring you enough attention and support to make a great living, to reach more people, to do great work. It's enough because a thousand fans, true fans, form a tribe.
A true fan brings three friends with him to a John Mayer concert or to the opening of a Chuck Close exhibit. A true fan pays extra to own the first edition, or buys the hardcover, instead of just browsing around on the Web site. Most important, a true fan connects with other true fans and amplifies the noise the artist makes.
A corporation or a nonprofit or a church may need more than that- perhaps a million fans if you're Starbucks, or fifteen million if you're running for president. But it's beyond doubt that there's a number— you can figure out what it is-and it's probably fewer people than you imagine.
Too many organizations care about numbers, not fans.
They care about hits or turnstile clicks or media mentions.
What they're missing is the depth commitment and inter-connection that true fans deliver. Instead of always being on the hunt for one more set of eyeballs, true leaders have figured out that the real win is in turning a casual fan into a true one.
Fans, true fans, are hard to find and precious. Just a few can change everything. What they demand, though, is generosity and bravery. P28/29

A remarkable product or service is like a purple cow. Brown cows are boring; purple ones are worth mentioning. Those ideas spread; those organizations grow. The essence of what's happening in the market today revolves around creating purple cows.
Here's the marketing math:
Ideas that spread, win.
Boring ideas don't spread. Boring organizations don't grow.
Working in an environment that's static is no fun. Even worse, working for an organization that is busy fighting off change is horrible. P38/39

Fear of failure is actually overrated as an excuse. Why?
Because if you work for someone, then, more often than not, the actual cost of the failure is absorbed by the organization, not by you. If your product launch fails, they're not going to fire you. The company will make a bit less money and will move on.
What people are afraid of isn't failure. It's blame. Criticism. We choose not to be remarkable because we're worried about criticism. We hesitate to create innovative movies, launch new human resource initiatives, design a menu that makes diners take notice, or give an audacious sermon because we're worried, deep down, that someone will hate it and call us on it. P39

from David Chang in his New York City kitchen to Nancy Pearl, Seattle's favorite librarian. They re generous. They exist to help the tribe find something, to enable the tribe to thrive. But they understand that the most powerful way to enable is to be statueworthy: by getting out front, by making a point, by challenging convention, and by speaking up. Those are brave acts, and bravery begets statues.
It's easy to hesitate when confronted with the feeling that maybe you're getting too much attention. Great leaders are able to reflect the light onto their teams, their tribes.
Great leaders don't want the attention, but they use it.
They use it to unite the tribe and to reinforce its sense of purpose.
When you abuse the attention, you are taking something from the tribe. When Fidel Castro gave six- or seven-hour-long speeches (with mandatory attendance), he was diminishing the energy of his tribe. When a CEO takes the spoils of royalty and starts acting like a selfish monarch, he's no longer leading. He's taking. P43

The first thing a leader can focus on is the act of tightening the tribe.
It's tempting to make the tribe bigger, to get more members, to spread the word. This pales, however, when juxtaposed with the effects of a tighter tribe. A tribe that communicates more quickly, with alacrity and emotion, is a tribe that thrives.
A tighter tribe is one that is more likely to hear its leader, and more likely still to coordinate action and ideas across the members of the tribe.
Steve Jobs at Apple has tightened the tribe of Apple fanatics in a variety of ways. By creating substantial new products and announcing them online, he's made it a ritual for Apple fanatics to "tune in" to hear what's new. Within hours of a new product announcement, the word has spread to millions or even tens of millions of users-all electronically, all online. At the same time, Apple has enjoyed an interesting side effect of Jobs's obsession with secrecy about new products: online rumor sites and speculation further fuel the conversations among Apple fans. Users will prototype imagined products and share pictures and even dig up obscure patents to prove their points. P44/45

I think, though, it's a mistake to believe that your best tribe recruits are blind sheep. Folks who do nothing but mindlessly follow instructions let you down in two ways.
First, they're not going to do the local leadership required when tribe members interact. They're going to be so busy following the playbook that they'll hesitate about engaging in the interactions that make a tight tribe such a vibrant organization. People don't engage merely to remind one another of the status quo. Instead, they eagerly engage when they want something to improve. This microleadership is essential to the health of your organization.
Second, they're not going to do a very good job of recruiting new members to your tribe. That's because evangelism requires leadership. Leading someone toward giving up one worldview and embracing yours isn't easy and it's not always comfortable. Consider any vibrant group political activ-ists, nonprofit volunteers, or brand fanatics. In each case, it's the microleaders in the trenches and their enthusiastic followers who make the difference, not the honcho who is ostensibly running the group. P48

Through your actions as a leader, you attract a tribe that wants to follow you. That tribe has a worldview that matches the message you're sending.
If you are leading a tribe focused on saving the world by fighting global warming, the tribe will, of course, have a worldview that includes the idea that global warming is a problem and that it can be addressed through its actions.
They come to the tribe with that in mind and your leadership resonates with them.
If, on the other hand, you choose to work to persuade a different group, one with a very different worldview, they will likely reject you. Al Gore started leading his tribe when he didn't know who they were. He stated his message and people found him.
Ultimately, people are most easily led where they wanted to go all along. While that may seem as if it limits your originality or influence, it's true. Fox News didn't persuade millions of people to become conservatives; they just assembled the tribe and led them where they were already headed. P56

Imagine two classrooms with similar teachers. One has fs-teen students, the other, thirty-two. Which group gets a ber-ter education? All other things being equal, the smaller class will always do better. The teacher has more time to spend customizing the lesson to each student. She has fewer students, hence fewer disruptions as well.
Now, flip the experiment around. What if the fifteen students are begrudgingly taking the course as a requirement for graduation, while the thirty-two had to apply to be admitted and are excited to be there. No contest.
Tribes are increasingly voluntary. No one is forced to work for your firm or attend your services. People have a choice of which music to listen to and which movies to watch.
So great leaders don't try to please everyone. Great leaders don't water down their message in order to make the tribe a bit bigger. Instead, they realize that a motivated, connected tribe in the midst of a movement is far more powerful than a larger group could ever be. P57

Leadership almost always involves thinking and acting like the underdog. That's because leaders work to change things, and the people who are winning rarely do.
What we did was (and what you do is) courageous. It requires bravery. Managing doesn't, and following the rules to make a living doesn't. It might be hard work, but it feels safe.
Changing things-pushing the envelope and creating a future that doesn't exist yet (at the same time you're criticized by everyone else-requires bravery.
And over the top? That's easy. Ordinary thinking and ordinary effort are almost never enough to generate leader-ship. That's because our inclination is to do barely enough.
It takes something extraordinary, a call to action that is irresistible, and a cause worth fighting for to make people actually join in.
If you're not over the top, you're not going to have any chance at all of making things happen. P73

Taking a look at the music business is a useful education for any heretic. It demonstrates how exceedingly intelligent people in a fairly new industry willfully ignored the world around them and hid. Those lessons apply to just about every industry you can imagine.
The first rule the music business failed to understand is that, at least at first, the new thing is rarely as good as the old thing was. If you need the alternative to be better than the status quo from the very start, you'll never begin.
Soon enough, the new thing will be better than the old thing. But if you wait until then, it's going to be too late. Feel free to wax nostalgic about the old thing, but don't fool yourself into believing that it's going to be here forever. It won't.
The second rule they missed is that past performance is no guarantee of future success.
Every single industry changes and, eventually, fades.
While you may have made money doing something a certain may yesterday, there's no reason to believe you'll succeed at tomorrow. P79

The music business was built around five pillars:

- Free radio promotion
- A limited number of competing music labels
- The high cost of production, requiring musicians to get financing from labels
- The Top 40 hits-based focus of the baby boomer gen-
eration
- A high-margin, nonreproducible medium (the LP)

Notice that none of these five pillars has anything to do with tribes or leadership.

One by one, each of these five pillars has crumbled over the past five years. The result is that while there is still plenty of music, the music business is in trouble.

The innovation: use digital distribution and the Internet like radio, but do it better. Be in the services/souvenir business, instead of suing customers and yearning for the old days. Find thousands of tribes for thousands of musicians and lead them where they want to go.
The best time to change your business model is while you still have momentum.
It's not so easy for an unknown artist to start from scratch and build a career self-publishing. Not so easy for her to find fans, one at a time, and build an audience. Very, very easy for a record label or a top artist to do so. So the time to jump was yesterday. Too late. Okay, how about today?
The sooner you do it, the more assets and momentum you have to put to work. P80/81

What marketers and organizers and people who care are discovering is that they can ignite a micromovement and then be propelled by the people who choose to follow it.
The key elements in creating a micromovement consist of five things to do and six principles:

1. Publish a manifesto.
Give it away and make it easy for the manifesto to spread far and wide. It doesn't have to be printed or even writ-ten. But it's a mantra and a motto and a way of looking at the world. It unites your tribe members and gives
them a structure.
2. Make it easy for your followers to connect with you.
It could be as simple as visiting you or e-mailing you or watching you on television. Or it could be as rich and complex as interacting with you on Facebook or joining your social network on Ning.
3. Make it easy for your followers to connect with one another.
There's that little nod that one restaurant regular gives to another recognized regular. Or the shared drink in an airport lounge. Even better is the camaraderie developed by volunteers on a political campaign or insiders involved in a new product launch. Great leaders figure out how to make these interactions happen.
4. Realize that money is not the point of a movement.
Money exists merely to enable it. The moment you try to cash out is the moment you stunt the growth of your
movement. 
5. Track your progress.
Do it publicly and create pathways for your followers to contribute to that progress.

Principles:

1. Transparency really is your only option.

Every failed televangelist has learned this the hard way.

The people who follow you aren't stupid. You might go down in scandal or, more likely, from ennui. People can smell subterfuge from a mile away.

1. Your movement needs to be bigger than you.
An author and his book, for example, don't constitute a movement. Changing the way people apply to college does.
2. Movements that grow, thrive.
Every day they get better and more powerful. You'll get there soon enough. Don't mortgage today just because you're in a hurry.
3. Movements are made most clear when compared to the status quo or to movements that work to push the other direction.
Movements do less well when compared to other movements with similar goals. Instead of beating them, join them.
4. Exclude outsiders.
Exclusion is an extremely powerful force for loyalty and attention. Who isn't part of your movement matters almost as much as who is.
5. Tearing others down is never as helpful to a movement are building your followers up. P88/89/90

My colleague Gil likes to quote U.S. Army Lieutenant General Russel Honoré, pointing out that too many people get "stuck on stupid."
I'm imagining that your colleagues aren't stupid. But when the world changes, the rules change. And if you insist on playing today's games by yesterday's rules, you're stuck.
Stuck with a stupid strategy. Because the world changed.
Some organizations are stuck. Others move quickly. In a
changing world, who's having more fun? P97

The Posture of a Leader
If you hear my idea but don't believe it, that's not your fault; it's mine.
If you see my new product but don't buy it, that's my failure, not yours.
If you attend my presentation and you're bored, that's my fault too.  If I fail to persuade you to implement a policy that supports my tribe, that's due to my lack of passion or skill, not your shortsightedness.
If you are a student in my class and you don't learn what
I'm teaching, I've let you down.
It's really easy to insist that people read the manual. It's really easy to blame the user/student/prospect/customer for not trying hard, for being too stupid to get it, or for not caring enough to pay attention. It might even be tempting to blame those in your tribe who aren't working as hard at following as you are at leading. But none of this is helpful.
What's helpful is to realize that you have a choice when you communicate. You can design your products to be easy to use. You can write so your audience hears you. You can present in a place and in a way that guarantees that the people you want to listen will hear you. Most of all, you get to choose who will understand (and who won't). P99/100

Switching Tribes
As your tribe grows, it's tempting to accelerate that growth, to find more people to join the tribe.
The most obvious prospects, of course, are already members of other tribes. If you can persuade that rabid soccer fan to switch to football instead, it's a coup. Or consider the full-page ad in the New York Times paid for by hundreds of evangelical Christians, encouraging religious Jews to switch teams. And there goes a politician, eagerly courting the loudest partisans from the other side to join her team instead. This rarely works.
People don't like to switch. We may eagerly join a company and slog through a job for years, staying until the place finally declares bankruptcy. No, it's not the same company we joined at the beginning, far from it, but to switch sides is to admit that we made a mistake. Growth doesn't come from persuading the most loyal members of other tribes to join you. They will be the last to come around. Instead, you'll find more fertile ground among seekers, among people who desire the feeling they get when they're part of a vibrant, growing tribe, but who are still looking for that feeling.
I'm not talking about disaffected outsiders, loners who work hard not to affiliate. I'm talking about people at the fringes, individuals who might jump from one thing to another with less angst.
If you're trying to persuade the tribe at work to switch from one strategy to the other, don't start with the leader of the opposition. Begin instead with the passionate individuals who haven't been embraced by other tribes yet. As you add more and more people like these, your option becomes safer and more powerful-then you'll see the others join you. P100/101

The curve below shows the benefits of almost any innovation over time:

![IMG_3510.jpeg](Tribes%20255d3798725d80d39d87d75fe0175303/IMG_3510.jpeg)

By the time you realize that your corner of the world is ready for an innovation, it's almost certainly too late. It's definitely not too early.
"It's not time," "Take it easy," "Wait and see," "It's someone else's turn" —none of these stalls are appropriate for a leader in search of change. There's a small price for being too early, but a huge penalty for being too late. The longer you wait to launch an innovation, the less your effort is worth. P102

The Forces of Mediocrity
Maybe it should be "the forces for mediocrity."
There's a myth that all you need to do is outline your vision and prove it's right-then, quite suddenly, people will line up and support you.
In fact, the opposite is true. Remarkable visions and genuine insight are always met with resistance. And when you start to make progress, your efforts are met with even more resistance. Products, services, career paths whatever it is, the forces for mediocrity will align to stop you, forgiving no errors and never backing down until it's over.
If it were any other way, it would be easy. And if it were any other way, everyone would do it and your work would ultimately be devalued. The yin and yang are clear: without people pushing against your quest to do something worth talking about, it's unlikely to be worth the journey. Persist. P109

Four million iPhones later (that's more than a billion dollars in less than a year), it's easy to forget that pundit Laura Reis said the Apple phone would never succeed. Visa and Master Card were huge ideas that took years to take off. Even little things, like that restaurant with a line out the door—it didn't open that way.
If your organization requires success before commitment, it will never have either.
Part of leadership (a big part of it, actually) is the ability to stick with the dream for a long time. Long enough that the critics realize that you're going to get there one way or another ... so they follow. P110

People don't believe what you tell them.
They rarely believe what you show them.
They often believe what their friends tell them.
They always believe what they tell themselves.
What leaders do: they give people stories they can tell themselves. Stories about the future and about change. P117
